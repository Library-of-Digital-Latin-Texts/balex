This edition of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, a text of unknown authorship belonging to the \textit{Corpus Caesarianum}, is the product of collaborations involving nearly 100 people. The text and critical apparatus were prepared under Cynthia Damon’s direction by students at the University of Pennsylvania between 2014 and 2019, as were the supplementary materials included in this edition: detailed textual notes on difficult passages (\textit{Studies on the Text of the Bellum Alexandrinum}), an appendix of singular readings (the Appendix critica), folio-by-folio transcriptions of the five manuscript witnesses used in the constitution of the text, and a translation. Damon converted the apparatus into a spreadsheet, and the LDLT team led by Sam Huskey at the University of Oklahoma converted both the text and the apparatus into the machine-readable form that underlies the version you are reading, either at the interactive LDLT website or as an on-demand .pdf. Damon and Huskey wrote this preface.\label{ftn1}\footnote{The processes summarized here have been the subject of several talks at the annual meeting of the Society for Classical Studies and will be described more fully in Damon and Huskey (in preparation).}
\subsection{Why a new edition of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}?}
\par
There are two answers to that question. The traditional answer is that the discoveries that underpin Damon's recent critical edition of Caesar’s \textit{Civil War} (Oxford, 2015) should also be used to reassess the text of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, which rests on the same manuscript witnesses.\label{ftn3}\footnote{OUP site: \xref{https://global.oup.com/academic/product/c-iuli-caesaris-commentarii-de-bello-civili-bellum-civile-or-civil-war-9780199659746?cc=us&lang=en&}{https://global.oup.com/academic/product/c-iuli-caesaris-commentarii-de-bello-civili-bellum-civile-or-civil-war-9780199659746?cc=us\&lang=en\&}.} But the real answer is that in the digital era we urgently need new editors, and that creating an edition such as this is an excellent way to expose students to the editing process. The next generation of critical editions, {\itshape digital} critical editions, can improve significantly on past editions, but only if there is a next generation of editors who possess the skills required for bringing them to fruition. That is why students, both graduate and undergraduate, have been involved in every step of this edition's preparation, from collating manuscripts to encoding the edition's data in XML according to the LDLT's guidelines. Their training has blended the methods of traditional textual criticism with digital humanities approaches to texts as data. The goal has been to prepare the next generation of editors to work on a digital paradigm.
\subsubsection{What is New?}

\paragraph{The text and apparatus:}\label{preface-what-is-new-text}
\par
As can be seen from the Conspectus editionum, our text differs from that of Andrieu 1954, which we used as our base text, in nearly 100 places. Eleven of these changes are a consequence of the new stemma, in which the manuscript that differs the most from the rest, S, is treated as a witness to the hyparchetype nu rather than as an independent witness to the archetype.\label{ftn4}\footnote{42.2 exercitus alendos, 49.2 causae, 57.3 †in†, 60.1 educerentur, 60.3 animaduerteret, 61.6 sibi usui, 62.1 auxiliares, 62.2 Marcello fauebant, 64.3 derectam, 66.1 praefecit, 66.5 inceptum.

More broadly, we hope to have improved the apparatus everywhere by making the arguments relevant to the constitution of the text more salient and more explicit (see further below for our policy on apparatus notes).
\paragraph{The machine-readable form:}\label{preface-what-is-new-machine}
\par
From the layout of the page to the typographical conventions used to represent manuscripts and other details about the text, traditional critical editions in print rely on complex visual cues to communicate information to readers who understand how to read and interpret those cues. For the most part, that information is inaccessible to a different type of reader: machines that can process and visualize information. If that information is presented in a way that both humans and machines can read and interpret, we can leverage the computational power of machines to open up new ways of exploring texts.\par
This is the first “born digital” edition of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}. It is encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML) according to the guidelines of the LDLT. That means that the typographical conventions familiar to readers of traditional editions will still be rendered on screen or paper in their familiar form, but machines can also recognize them as more than just strings of characters. Rather, what a human reads as a crux (†), a machine can read in its own language. That is why this edition can be read in an online viewing platform, visualized with any number of data visualization tools, queried like a database, or rendered in a traditional form as a print-ready PDF.
\subsection{I. The \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}}
\par
The work now known as the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} or {\itshape War in Alexandria} was completed after the assassination of Caesar in 44 BCE, probably in connection with an attempt by Caesar’s supporters to produce an edition of texts narrating Caesar’s military achievements (see the Letter to Balbus prefaced to {\itshape Gallic War} 8, written by Aulus Hirtius). The title is misleading, since only the first of the five campaigns described in the work occurred in Alexandria. The Caesarian commanders and theaters of war are as follows: Caesar in Alexandria (chh. 1-33; September 48 -February 47), Domitius Calvinus in Pontus (34-41; September-October 48), Cornificius, Gabinius, and Vatinius in Illyricum (42-47; October 48 - January 47), Q. Cassius in Spain (48-64; May-December 48), Caesar in Pontus (65-78; March-May 47).\label{ftn8}\footnote{The dates (Julian) are taken from Raaflaub and Ramsey 2017. } None of Caesar’s officers is known to have participated in all of these overlapping campaigns. As a result, the narrative, like Caesar’s own commentaries, must rest on sources written by various hands. The identity of the person who compiled these reports and turned them into a coherent narrative is unknown now and was unclear already in antiquity (Suetonius, {\itshape Jul}. 56.1). Between the copy from which Suetonius draws several excerpts and the nearly 200 medieval manuscripts that survive the history of the text is hard to discern, but it is clear that all of the surviving witnesses ultimately rest on a single copy of the text that was produced during the Carolingian period: they share significant errors that must go back to a single source. For the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, a work of just under 11,000 words, they number about 150. \label{ftn9}\footnote{The word count used by Gaertner and Hausburg is 10513 (see, e.g., 2013, 286).} The most striking are the gaps (12.1, 17.3, 17.6, 22.2) and the insoluble problems (2.5 †obiectis†, 22.2 †multum†, 57.2 †noctu†, 57.3 †in†). But almost every page of the critical apparatus shows one or more spots where the reading of the archetype is not the reading in the text.
\subsection{II. Constituting the text}

\subsubsection{A. The stemma}
\par
The foundations of the present edition are Damon 2015a and Damon 2015b.\label{ftn10}\footnote{For a fuller discussion of the history of the text and of editorial work on the Caesarian corpus see the Preface to Damon 2015a and the first chapter of Damon 2015b.} The{\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} rests on the same five independent manuscript witnesses as Caesar’s {\itshape Bellum ciuile}. We looked for evidence that would challenge the stemma proposed for the {\itshape Bellum ciuile}, but found nothing conclusive.\label{ftn11}\footnote{As was the case for the {\itshape Bellum ciuile}, the “good readings” in {\bfseries S}, which have traditionally been taken as evidence of agreement in error by the hyparchetypes mu and pi and proof that they have a common ancestor, can be explained as scribal emendations. Examples are given in the description of {\bfseries S} below.} Accordingly, we used the same bipartite stemma.
\subsubsection{B. The witnesses}
\label{ftn12}\footnotetext{More detailed versions of the following paragraphs are given in Damon 2015a, xxii-xxvi and 2015b, 55-61.}

\paragraph{1. The archetype}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-archetype}
\par
The stemma allowed us to reconstruct the text of the archetype of the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} in most of the hundreds of places where the manuscripts disagree, but as was mentioned earlier, that archetype has to be emended in roughly 140 spots. Regular sources of error in the archetype include abbreviations, {\itshape scriptura continua}, and inversions. Some of the archetype’s original readings seem to have been altered in such a way that both the original reading and the correction (or “correction”) were visible to the scribes of the two hyparchetypes, {\bfseries mu} (the common source of {\bfseries M} and {\bfseries U}) and {\bfseries nu} (the common source of {\bfseries S} and {\bfseries pi}, the common source of {\bfseries T} and {\bfseries V}).\label{ftn13}\footnote{Possible instances can be found throughout the apparatus, but the clearest examples are these: 9.3 dediticiis {\itshape U}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}{\itshape SV et M}\textsuperscript{\itshape mr} : dedi(c/t)iis {\itshape MU}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac}{\itshape T}; 10.6 successuros {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}{\itshape US} : successoros {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac} : succens(u/o)res {\itshape T}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}{\itshape V} : succensuros {\itshape T}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac }; 15.5 pugnae {\itshape MT}\textsuperscript{\itshape c} : pugna {\itshape UST}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac}{\itshape V}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac} : pugnandi {\itshape V}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}; 26.2 ibi suum {\itshape UST et M}\textsuperscript{\itshape mr} : suum ibi {\itshape MV}; 32.3 precari {\itshape MT}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}{\itshape V} : precare {\itshape UST}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac}; 45.1 cum Vatinium {\itshape MUV} : eum uatinium {\itshape T} : eum uatinium cum {\itshape S}; 46.2 contra illo remigante {\itshape M} ({\itshape cf. BG 7.28.1 contra ueniretur}) : contra illum remigantem {\itshape SV} : contra illo remigantem {\itshape UT}; 56.4 creabat {\itshape UST} : credebat {\itshape MV}; 57.3 ex {\itshape USV} : et {\itshape MT} ; 58.3 inscriptum {\itshape UST} : scriptum {\itshape MV}; 60.4 esse {\itshape U}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac}{\itshape STV} : eum {\itshape MU}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}; 73.2 triarium {\itshape MS} : traiarium {\itshape UTV}; 74.4 in procliuem {\itshape Nipperdey} : in proelium {\itshape ST }: in bellum {\itshape V} : praeruptam in proelium {\itshape U }: in praeruptam {\itshape M. }Other examples of innovations in the archetype that aim to repair the text include: 27.1 [a]; 29.3 [fluminum]; 70.3 [non]; 78.3 [legibus].} Disagreement among our manuscript witnesses also arises from other features of the archetype, such as variant readings and glosses.\label{ftn14}\footnote{Variants: 12.1 classiariorum {\itshape USTV et M supra lineam} : nauigatorum {\itshape M}; 24.1 statuit {\itshape UTV et M supra lineam} : constituit {\itshape M }({\itshape deest S}); 27.5 prudentia {\itshape MUS}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}{\itshape V et T supra lineam} : potentia {\itshape S}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac}{\itshape T}; 34.1 prouincias {\itshape USTV et M supra lineam} : regiones {\itshape M}; 46.4 dubitabant {\itshape USTV et M supra lineam} : dubitarent {\itshape M}; 73.3 discederet {\itshape USTV et M supra lineam} : cessaret {\itshape M}. Glosses: 17.2 [urbem]; 27.5 [uirtutum … imprudentia]; 37.3 [rex]; 46.1 [fortunae].}
\paragraph{2. The hyparchetypes}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-hyparchetypes}
\par
The hyparchetypes that transmitted the archetype’s text to the extant manuscripts are hard to discern in this tradition; our work on the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} turned up no new and conclusive evidence for them.\label{ftn15}\footnote{The most suggestive evidence from the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} is discussed at Damon 2015b, 34-36.}\textsuperscript{} 
\subparagraph{a. μ}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-hyparchetypes-a}
\par
Numerous innovations common to {\bfseries M} and {\bfseries U} are consistent with descent from a hyparchetype, {\bfseries μ}. In the {\itshape BAlex} the most telling are these, where the reading in {\bfseries ν} is likely to be archetypal: \begin{itemize}
\item 4.2 militem {\itshape STV} : milites {\itshape MU }
\item 7.1 Alexandrini {\itshape STV} : Alexandrinis {\itshape MU}
\item 16.2 qui {\itshape STV }: quis {\itshape MU}
\item 19.2 certiorem {\itshape STV} : fortiorem {\itshape MU}
\item 27.7 adiuncti his {\itshape STV}: adiunctis (h)iis {\itshape MU}
\item 33.2 imperia {\itshape ST} : imperio {\itshape MU} : imperiam {\itshape V }: imperium {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape mr }
\item 37.2 cum uereretur {\itshape S} : uereretur {\itshape TV }: ueritus {\itshape MU}
\item 55.3 adfectus {\itshape STV }: a(d/f)fecit {\itshape MU}
\item 56.2 dolore {\itshape STV} : dolori {\itshape MU }
\item 74.3 quem\textsuperscript{1} {\itshape STV} : quem cum legione {\itshape M} : cum legione quem {\itshape U}
\item 75.1 oppressus {\itshape STV} : oppressos {\itshape MU}\end{itemize} \par
Significant innovations unique to {\bfseries M} or {\bfseries U} show that neither is descended from the other. Innovations of the sort that could not be corrected by conjecture, for example, include the following: \begin{itemize}
\item 1.2 operibus {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 1.2 uidentur {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 2.3 in … locis {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M }({\itshape uerba 4})
\item 9.1 negotium {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 14.5 sic … Africae {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M} ({\itshape uerba 8})
\item 16.4 falleret {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M}
\item 17.1 ad insulam {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 26.1 Caesaris {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 27.5 undique {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M}
\item 37.5 pro uallo {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 40.4 non amplius {\itshape om.}{\itshape\bfseries  }{\bfseries M}
\item 44.2 misit {\itshape om}. {\bfseries M}
\item 45.2 aduersam {\itshape om}. {\bfseries M}
\item 57.6 prouincia {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 58.2 Pompei {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 58.3 milites adeo fatebantur {\itshape om.} {\bfseries M}
\item 61.1 Marcellus {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M}
\item 63.2 Marcellus {\itshape om. }{\bfseries M}
\item 67.2 populi Romani {\itshape per compendia om}. {\bfseries M}
\item 76.1 acri {\itshape om}. {\bfseries M}
\item 6.3 uero {\itshape om. }{\bfseries U}
\item 18.4 ex his {\itshape om.} {\bfseries U}
\item 30.3 numero {\itshape om.} {\bfseries U}
\item 50.1 faceret quae {\itshape om}. {\bfseries U}\end{itemize} \par
As was the case in the {\itshape Bellum ciuile}, the relative lengths of these two lists suggests that {\bfseries U} is a more faithful copy of {\bfseries μ} than {\bfseries M} is; this is borne out by other sorts of singular readings, which are far more numerous in {\bfseries M} than in {\bfseries U}, as can be seen in the \hyperref[appendix-critica]{Appendix critica}.\par
Where {\bfseries μ} and {\bfseries ν} diverge, as they do more than 60 times in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, {\bfseries μ} more often offers a good reading, either by conjecture or by preserving the archetype.
\subparagraph{b. ν}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-hyparchetypes-b}
\par
Innovations common to {\bfseries S} and {\bfseries π} are consistent with descent from a hyparchetype, {\bfseries ν}. In the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} the most telling are these, where the reading in {\bfseries μ} is likely to be archetypal: \begin{itemize}
\item 19.2 quod {\itshape MU} : {\itshape om. STV}
\item 25.1 commeatum {\itshape MU} : commeatumque {\itshape STV}
\item 44.3 non {\itshape MU} : {\itshape om. STV}
\item 44.3 iusta ad {\itshape MU} : iuxta ad {\itshape STV}
\item 48.2 esset MU : {\itshape om. STV}
\item 49.2 causae {\itshape MU}: causa {\itshape STV }
\item 5.3 isdem {\itshape MU} : idem {\itshape STV}
\item 56.6 ut {\itshape MU}: {\itshape om. STV}
\item 59.1 tamque {\itshape MU} : ta(m/n)quam {\itshape STV}
\item 61.4 confligeret {\itshape MU} : confligere {\itshape STV}
\item 68.1 frequentes {\itshape MUT }: frequenter {\itshape SV}
\item 70.8 ei MU : {\itshape om. STV}
\item 71.1 proficisceretur {\itshape STV} : proficisceretur existimabat {\itshape MU}\end{itemize} \par
Significant innovations unique to {\bfseries S} or {\bfseries π} show that neither is descended from the other. Omissions of the sort that could not be corrected by conjecture, for example, include the following: \begin{itemize}
\item 1.5 rei … alterius {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S }({\itshape uerba 4})
\item 2.1 magnumque … adduxerant {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S }({\itshape uerba 12})
\item 15.8 atque … exposceret {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S }({\itshape uerba 16})
\item 17.5 constiterunt … litore {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S }({\itshape uerba 12})
\item 19.6 pugnabatur … ({\itshape 24.2}) ut ad {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S}
\item 27.5 constantiaque … imprudentia {\itshape om. }{\bfseries S }({\itshape uerba 5})
\item 31.1 uirum {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S}\textsuperscript{} 
\item 57.5 namque {\itshape om.} {\bfseries S}
\item 74.4 inanem {\itshape om}. {\bfseries S}
\item 8.3 qui {\itshape MUS} : {\itshape om.} {\itshape T}
\item 14.1 eorum {\itshape MUS} : {\itshape om. TV}
\item 46.4 erant {\itshape MUS} : {\itshape om. TV}
\item 68.1 consul esset {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape c }{\itshape et uocibus perpere diuisis U }: consules sed {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac} : consules se {\itshape S }: consules {\itshape TV non male}
\item 70.5 se {\itshape MUS} : {\itshape om. TV}
\item 76.1 in {\itshape MUS} : {\itshape om. TV}\label{ftn16}\footnote{Textual variation between {\bfseries π} and {\bfseries μ} in some of the many passages omitted by {\bfseries S} make it unlikely that these omissions were filled by contamination from the {\bfseries μ} branch. There are also some small discrepancies between {\bfseries S} and {\bfseries μ} in text omitted by {\bfseries π} (see above on 68.1). It is therefore likely that in all of the passages listed above {\bfseries ν}'s text was complete and transmitted to one of its two descendants.}\end{itemize} \par
The relative number of words omitted in these two lists suggests that {\bfseries π} is a more faithful copy of {\bfseries ν} than {\bfseries S} is; this is borne out by other sorts of singular readings, which are vastly more numerous in {\bfseries S} than in {\bfseries π}.\par
Where {\bfseries ν} and {\bfseries μ} diverge, {\bfseries ν} is more often in error than {\bfseries μ} is, either by preserving a corrupt archetype or by innovating.
\subparagraph{c. π}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-hyparchetypes-c}
\par
A large number of shared innovations both link {\bfseries T} and {\bfseries V} and separate them from the rest of the tradition, more than 50 for the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}; the traditional siglum for the source of these innovations is {\bfseries π}.\label{ftn17}\footnote{Hering (1963, 40) lists six substantial omissions common to {\bfseries T} and {\bfseries V} in the {\itshape BG}. There is another at {\itshape BHisp} 40.2. (The relationship between {\bfseries T} and {\bfseries V} is the same for all fourteen books of the Caesarian corpus.)} The separative innovations in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} also include a handful of brief omissions (see above), and an inversion, another variety of innovation that, once made, tends to persist in an uncontaminated tradition: 35.2 suo regno {\itshape MUS} : regno suo {\itshape TV}. Finally, among the innovations unique to these two manuscripts in the {\itshape BAlex} are some two dozen that repair the corrupt archetype and, once made, are unlikely to have been removed except by accident: \begin{itemize}
\item 15.8 in pugna occupatum animum haberent {\itshape TV} : inpugnatioccupatum animum haberent {\itshape S} : in pugna occupatum animum haberet {\itshape U }: pugna haberet occupatum animum {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape ac} : pugna occupatum animum haberet {\itshape M}\textsuperscript{\itshape c}
\item 19.1 propior {\itshape TV} : prior {\itshape MUS}
\item 22.1 accessiones {\itshape TV} : accensiones {\itshape MU }({\itshape deest S})
\item 24.1 postularent {\itshape TV} : postularet ({\itshape sc. }rex) {\itshape MU uix recte }({\itshape deest S})
\item 66.4 sacerdotium {\itshape TV }: sacerdotum {\itshape S} : sacerdotio {\itshape MU}\end{itemize} \par
For the hyparchetypes discussed above, {\bfseries μ} and {\bfseries ν}, it was a simple matter to show the independence of the two earliest descendants of each ({\bfseries M} and {\bfseries U}; {\bfseries S} and {\bfseries π}). This is not the case for {\bfseries π}. A detailed discussion of the relationship between {\bfseries T} and {\bfseries V} is presented in Damon 2015b. Our work on the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} turned up no new and conclusive evidence. We report the readings of T and V throughout.
\paragraph{3. The extant manuscripts}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-extant-manuscripts}

For detailed descriptions of the five manuscripts used to constitute the text see Damon 2015a, xxxiv-lxi. Here we indicate the folio numbers in each for the text of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} and the noteworthy innovations. Full transcriptions are available online at the LDLT website (see further below).
\subparagraph{a. M}\label{preface-constituting-the-text-witnesses-extant-manuscripts-m}
\par
{\bfseries M} is a manuscript in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, shelf mark Plut. lat. 68.8.\label{ftn18}\footnote{High quality page images of {\bfseries M} can be viewed at \xref{http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOIs_iEI1A4r7GxML1h&c=Caesaris\%20Commentaria\#/oro/13}{https://bit.ly/3HCkcSG}.} The {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum }occupies ff. 133v-143r. {\bfseries M} offers some uniquely successful or meritorious innovations (those marked with an asterisk are particularly impressive\label{ftn19}\footnote{Also noteworthy in {\bfseries M}: 11.2 conspectu ⟨suorum⟩ {\itshape Khan} : conspectu hostium {\itshape M }: conspectu {\itshape USTV} :{\itshape an} conspectu ⟨omnium⟩{\itshape ?}; 48.1 multis {\itshape UTV} : mutis {\itshape M} : mutus {\itshape S.}}; there are of course other spots where {\bfseries M} has been joined by one or another manuscript in a successful innovation): \begin{itemize}

These folios contain, besides the text, a small number of brief marginal comments on content, either factual (e.g., “situs Alexandrie” 85v, “epibatis” 86v, “berones” 92r, “dinastas” “tarsus” 93v) or moral (e.g., “laus euphranoris” 87r, “mors euphranoris” 87v), along with the familiar “quaere” and “nota bene” symbols. The singular readings in {\bfseries U} are far fewer than those of {\bfseries M}, {\bfseries S}, {\bfseries T}, or {\bfseries V}, as can be seen in the Appendix critica.\label{ftn21}\footnote{In the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} {\bfseries U} has roughly 80 singular readings listed in the Appendix critica; the approximate figures for the other manuscripts are as follows: {\bfseries M }170, {\bfseries S} 260, {\bfseries T} 130, {\bfseries V} 165.

{\bfseries S} is a manuscript in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, shelf mark Ashburnhamensis 33. The {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum }occupies ff. 121r-134v.

\subsection{III. Using this edition}
\par
The \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} has come down to us in a very imperfect state. The ongoing process of rendering it readable and at least arguably authentic has resulted in a text that differs in hundreds of spots from that transmitted by the manuscripts. The critical apparatus of this edition is designed to facilitate scrutiny of these textual repairs. We hope that readers will accept repairs not because they are there but because they are persuasive, or better than others, or better than nothing. Some of the damage incurred in the text's transmission seems irreparable: where text has been lost, for example, or where rival repairs are equally (im)plausible. These spots are marked with \gap{} and †† respectively. But the vast majority of the problem spots are amenable to emendation, and the apparatus presents the evidence and (in brief) the arguments for the repairs adopted or proposed.
\subsubsection{A. Text}
\par
In general terms the text of this edition aims to reproduce the text of the archetype of our tradition, as emended where it seems possible to restore a text closer to the original. However, several expedients adopted to improve the legibility of the text constitute exceptions to this policy.\par
The spelling of names and common Latin words and forms is silently regularized where the manuscript variants are not relevant to understanding the text or its transmission. The lemmata in the critical apparatus match the reading in the text (except in capitalization) and therefore do not necessarily represent the spelling in the manuscripts cited.\par
Abbreviations and symbols are silently spelled out where there is no ambiguity about the full form of the word. (For the special case of numbers see below.) Roman praenomina are an exception to this general rule, since we use the standard abbreviations (C. for Gaius, Cn. for Gnaeus, L. for Lucius, and so on), regardless of what is in the text. The phrase {\itshape per compendium} in the apparatus indicates that a manuscript contains an abbreviation when this information is helpful for understanding the transmission of the text. But the absence of such an indication should not be taken to imply that the text is written in full. All of the manuscripts cited here use abbreviations to a greater ({\bfseries U}) or lesser ({\bfseries TV}) or variable ({\bfseries MS}) degree. The phrase {\itshape compendio indicato} indicates that a word is presented as an abbreviation in the manuscript but that the significance of the abbreviation is unclear.\par
We have silently regularized the manuscripts' inconsistent and discrepant representations of cardinal and ordinal numbers. For one, two, and three we use the inflected forms, and for most cardinal numbers higher than three we use Roman numerals, since the inflected forms of large numerical adjectives and adverbs are cumbersome in Latin and less perspicuous than their symbolic counterparts. However, we do spell out {\itshape mille} and the inflected forms of {\itshape milia}. Ordinal numbers are spelled out; this is particularly useful in connection with legions, where the difference between, say, “five legions” and “the fifth legion” is significant. Distributive numbers, which are infrequent in this text, are also spelled out.\par
We used modern punctuation in the text since the punctuation in the manuscripts is neither consistent nor reliable. The terminal punctuation for main clauses is generally a full stop. Where a series of actions seems to gain from presentation as a series, on the other hand, we use commas instead of full stops. But in many instances there was rather little to tip the balance. In extended passages of indirect statement we use semicolons to indicate sentence breaks. Commas are used to articulate the text where clause structure and word order are not sufficient (see further below). We occasionally use paired dashes to indicate a gap between the narrative and an embedded utterance such as an editorializing comment by the author, an afterthought, or a “snippet” of indirect statement, where commas don't suffice.\label{ftn28}\footnote{See Damon (2020) on such parentheses. } Where such utterances extend for a sentence or more and full stops don't suffice we use parentheses rather than dashes. Single dashes precede instances of anacoluthon. Pointed and square brackets indicate additions to (⟨ ⟩) and excisions from ([ ]) the text that involve complete words. Where syllables or individual letters are added or excised the change is not signaled in the text but the relevant information can be found in the apparatus. In general Incertus’ prose requires more punctuation than Caesar’s. For passages where the periodic style consists of a heavily punctuated accumulation of clauses see, e.g., 1.4-5 ({\itshape Caesar … poterat}), 14.5 ({\itshape Erant … uidebantur}), 24.1-2 ({\itshape Caesar … puerum}), 35.2 ({\itshape Domitius … fuisset}), 42.2-3 ({\itshape Namque … sociorum}), 43.1 ({\itshape Gabinius … gerebat}), 44.1 ({\itshape Vatinius … praeparationis}), 44.3-4 ({\itshape Quod … persequeretur}), 48.1 ({\itshape Iis … cupiebat}).\par
Paragraphs are generally those established by Jungermann's 1606 edition, which serve as the basis for the modern citation system. Units within the paragraphs are numbered as in Andrieu 1954.\par
The features of the text described so far are available in both online and print versions of the LDLT edition.\label{ftn29}\footnote{Since the edition itself is an XML file, it is important to note that “online and print versions” refer to visualizations of the data in that file. The LDLT's official online reading application is based on the \xref{https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean}{CETEIcean} application developed by Hugh Cayless and Raffaele Viglianti. This edition can be viewed in the LDLT's online reading application at  The print version is available as a PDF in the code repository for this edition.} But the LDLT's official online version has one important feature that cannot be reproduced on paper: dynamic swapping. Unlike traditional editions, in which variant readings are collected in a critical apparatus at the bottom of each page, the LDLT's online reading application not only places the critical apparatus in the margin where the variation occurs, but also allows readers to swap variant readers into the text so that they can be evaluated \textit{in situ}. Every attempt has been made to eliminate the possibility of introducing novel readings into the text. This is a hazard when variants in two places are related to each other: If a reader swaps one of the variants into the text, the one related to it elsewhere should be swapped, too. Otherwise, this dynamic swapping feature could create a version of the text that never existed previously. This is why we opted not to encode certain combinations of variants to enable the swapping feature, since the application, at least at the time this was written, was not able to render them reliably.
\subsubsection{B. Critical apparatus}
\par
There is an entry in the apparatus criticus if any of the following circumstances applies for a word or phrase in the text:\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] If the reading of the archetype is uncertain: {\bfseries μ}≠{\bfseries ν}, or {\bfseries MS}≠{\bfseries Uπ}, etc. In choices between equally authoritative variants we have put in the text the one that offers the best sense and style. Or, if these criteria fail, the {\itshape lectio difficilior.} If no other criterion suffices, we follow {\bfseries U}, which is the least deviant manuscript. In some places these criteria pull in different directions.
\item[2] If there may be a disagreement between {\bfseries μ} and {\bfseries ν}: {\bfseries μS}≠{\bfseries π}, {\bfseries U}≠{\bfseries Mν}, etc. We list this category separately from (1) because it is often difficult, owing to the waywardness of {\bfseries S}, to determine the reading of {\bfseries ν}. The same is true, but to a much lesser extent, about {\bfseries μ}, owing to {\bfseries M}'s propensity to stray.
\item[3] If the manuscript evidence warrants display for some other reason. Readings unique to a particular manuscript—\textit{lectiones singulares} or singular readings—are generally recorded in the \hyperref[appendix-critica]{Appendix critica} if the text is not in doubt, but multi-word omissions are also reported in the apparatus since they provide crucial information about the shape of hyparchetype families. When other sorts of singular readings are reported in the apparatus, they are mentioned for their value as emendations. Where two manuscripts have different singular readings at the same spot we generally record this in the apparatus.\label{ftn30}\footnote{In some cases the \hyperref[appendix-critica]{Appendix critica} seemed the more appropriate home for the information, especially when unrelated errors were typical of their manuscripts or where one of the two errors has been corrected by the scribe.}
\item[4] If the syntax is faulty, showing omissions, problems of agreement, etc. The problem is fixed in the text if possible, even if the solution adopted is only one of several possible solutions. But sometimes a lacuna (indicated by \gap{}) is indicated instead.\label{ftn31}\footnote{For the more difficult examples of categories (4)–(7) there are notes explaining our reasoning in \hyperref[commentary]{Studies on the Text of the Bellum Alexandrinum}. These are signaled by a diamond (◊) in the apparatus note.}
\item[5] If the usage is or appears to be problematic. In this situation, the problem is usually fixed in the text, unless it can be attributed to the author himself. This large category is subject to some limitations. \begin{enumerate}
\item[a] We rarely make notes involving the regularization of acceptable syntax. A very common type of emendation involves verb forms. E.g., where in a series of historical present tense verbs one finds a perfect. These generally require trivial textual intervention. But readers can spot these discrepancies for themselves and decide about the suitability of the preserved reading and the repairs available. The fact that someone before them has also queried the text is unlikely to help resolve the problem, and such notes, which would be very very numerous, would clog the apparatus.\label{ftn32}\footnote{The {\bfseries α} and {\bfseries β} branches of the tradition of the {\itshape BG} frequently differ over verb tenses, which leads one to suspect that in our tradition, which is limited to the {\bfseries β} branch, tense errors will be numerous (see further Damon 2015b, 100-104).} Emendations of this sort (and of those discussed below) can be seen in the Conspectus editionum. However, where such emendations remove a contradiction within the text they are usually either accepted or at least reported. Similarly if they help address an otherwise problematic passage or draw attention to a notable feature of the text such as a \textit{constructio ad sensum}. (This logic and these exceptions also apply to the following two categories.)
\item[b] We rarely make notes involving the addition or excision or interchange of verb prefixes. 
\item[c] We rarely make notes involving the addition or excision of the connectives {\itshape et} and -{\itshape que}, or the interchange of -{\itshape que} and -{\itshape ue}. A glance at the apparatus will show that these words are frequently overlooked or added by our manuscripts.
\item[d] We rarely make notes involving diction. Unlike categories (a)–(c), such notes sometimes involve substantial changes to the text, and the presumed innovations have to be explained as substitutions (deliberate or unconscious) by the scribe.\label{ftn33}\footnote{Or additions. We also refrain from making notes about possible intrusive glosses, as long as they don't interfere with the comprehension of the text.} Spotting this sort of problem is an almost infinite task, as there are many words in the text for which one could think of a more apt, a more common, or at least a different expression. The fact that in the {\itshape BG} tradition there are numerous synonym-variants between the {\bfseries α} and {\bfseries β} branches (see Damon 2015b, 100-104) almost guarantees that some of the expressions in our text were not those originally chosen by the author, and one advantage of notes on diction would be to call attention to anomalies, but at the cost of suggesting, even if only gently, that dictional anomalies need to be fixed. Readers who are sensitive enough to diction to look to the apparatus when an expression seems odd already have what they need to analyse the situation. This is obviously a matter for editorial judgment, and “rarely” does not mean “never.”
\end{enumerate}
\item[6] If the sense is or appears to be problematic on grounds of either history or logic. Such a problem is fixed in the text unless it can be attributed to the author himself. A number of these passages involve names.\label{ftn34}\footnote{For example, we printed the transmitted spelling, even though epigraphic evidence suggests that it is wrong, at 42.3 \textit{Iadertinorum} and 48.2 \textit{Medobrigam}. Incertus might not have known the local or accepted spelling of these rather out of the way toponyms. Like Caesar, Incertus is inconsistent in his use of the \textit{tria nomina}, both at an individual’s introduction, where he sometimes supplies the \textit{praenomen} and sometimes doesn’t, and subsequently. Q. Cassius Longinus, for example, is sometimes called Cassius, sometimes Longinus.}
\item[7] If the text is or appears to be suspect on other grounds. Numbers are responsible for most of this category. Sometimes no solution can be proposed but it still seems worth marking the problem.
\end{enumerate}\par
Parallel passages are often cited in the apparatus to defend the text, a variant, or an emendation, but only when the available parallels are rare; regular usage speaks for itself. In directing the reader to parallels we use \textit{uide} [{\itshape u}.] for passages illustrating the matter, \textit{confer} [{\itshape cf}.] for passages illustrating the expression. If a parallel from the Caesarian corpus is given, it is the best one, and often the only one, unless “etc.” follows, in which case there are up to five or so pertinent parallels. If parallels are given for distinct aspects of the phrase in question, \textit{et} is interposed between citations. If a parallel is given from outside of the Caesarian corpus, no adequate parallel exists within the corpus. Where the cited parallel nevertheless provides only indifferent support for the reading it defends, the reading can be assessed accordingly.\par
In this edition the readings of all of the principal manuscripts are stated for every lemma. This makes it easy for the reader to follow the behavior and affiliations of the manuscripts over large stretches of text. It also facilitates the task of assessing the arguments about readings in the text, since the lemmata and the evidence for them are listed alongside the conflicting evidence.\par
Orthographical variants and the related category of abbreviations abound in this tradition (see Damon 2015a, xxiii). They are generally ignored in the apparatus, unless a variant helps explain subsequent innovations, as is sometimes the case for abbreviations in particular. \par
Citations for works of classical literature are given in the abbreviated forms standardized by the {\itshape OLD} and Liddell-Scott-Jones. (With space-saving exceptions for the six works in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, which appear as {\itshape BG}, Hirt., {\itshape BC}, {\itshape BAlex}, {\itshape BAfr}, {\itshape BHisp}.) Citations without titles refer to the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum.}\par
Scholars are cited by name only, or by name and date if it is necessary to distinguish among their works. Full bibliographic information is given in the \hyperref[bibliography]{List of works cited}.\label{ftn35}\footnote{In the long history of work on the text of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} some emendations have lost their source. Where other editors ascribe a reading to “{\itshape edd}.,” we have named the earliest source we can find. We use {\itshape\bfseries ς} if we can verify that a reading is in a manuscript other than those used here to constitute the text. (This usually means that the reading is in {\bfseries L} or {\bfseries N} or {\bfseries R.}) Otherwise we give the earliest edition in which it appears. Emendations credited to the first edition (“ed. pr.”) are presumably drawn from a manuscript source.}
\subsubsection{C. Appendix critica}
\par
In the Appendix critica we record the singular readings of the principal manuscripts in passages where the text is not in doubt. (Where a singular reading is useful for the constitution of the text it is recorded in the critical apparatus.) This collection of readings illustrates the character of the witnesses to the text, allowing the reader to see both the frequency and the types of errors in each. Lemmata are provided to show the nature of the error. The spelling of the lemma is that of the printed text. Orthographical variants are not registered in the Appendix. An erroneous reading ascribed to {\bfseries M}\textsuperscript{\bfseries ac} (or {\bfseries M}\textsuperscript{\bfseries c}) implies that {\bfseries M}\textsuperscript{\bfseries c} (or {\bfseries M}\textsuperscript{\bfseries ac}) has the reading of the lemma. All singular omissions are listed. Omissions notable for length or content are also reported in the apparatus criticus. An asterisk marks errors in {\bfseries M} that prompted a correction—not necessarily a successful one—by {\bfseries M}\textsuperscript{\bfseries mr}.
\subsection{Additional materials in the LDLT edition:}

\subsubsection{Studies on the Text of the Bellum Alexandrinum}
\par
Twenty-three notes on difficult spots in the text by members of the Latin 540 classes in 2015 and 2017. These present in depth the arguments that underlie the various remedies suggested in the edition's critical apparatus. They are signaled in the relevant apparatus note by a diamond (◊) before the lemma. 
\subsubsection{Transcriptions of the manuscript witnesses (MUSTV)}
\par
The five manuscript witnesses used to constitute the text were transcribed by members of the Postbac Latin seminars in 2014 and 2016, and by highschool volunteers in the summer of 2016. The transcriptions were checked and doublechecked by the transcribing teams, by other class members, and by the Latin 540 students who used the transcriptions to generate the critical apparatus. Machine-collation was used to locate discrepancies that needed verification; we used the collation tool at juxtacommons.org. (For the process see Damon and Huskey, forthcoming.) Errors certainly remain, and many features of the original are not reflected in these simple documents, but they are helpful maps for finding a particular bit of text in a manuscript book or a page image. Abbreviations are filled out unless obscure (as is sometimes the case with monetary amounts, for example), punctuation is ignored, and capitalization is reproduced rather erratically. Where a manuscript contains a correction the transcription records the corrected form, not the original reading; the original readings were recorded elsewhere and are taken account of in the apparatus and Appendix critica. 
\subsubsection{Translation}
\par
The students in the two Latin 540 classes produced a translation of the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} in the course of their work on the text. It is a work of many hands and makes no claim to stylistic merit or even consistency. It is designed to communicate our interpretation of the text, particularly where we have emended it.
\subsubsection{Conspectus editionum}
\par
A list of the 98 places where the reading of the LDLT {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} differs from that of Andrieu 1954, which we used as our base text. (Differences of orthography and punctuation are not reported.)
\subsection{Acknowledgements}
\par
As we said at the outset, this edition rests on the work of many contributors. It couldn’t have been done without them, or without the financial and other forms of support for research provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and our two home institutions, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma. Our largest debts are recorded below, but the process has been a long one and we are grateful to all who kept us company along the way, even on the “paths not (or not yet) taken” that are an inevitable part of a project as complex as this one proved to be. Information on the collaborations and support that resulted in the platform and protocols that host and govern this edition can be found at the \xref{https://digitallatin.org/}{Digital Latin Library} and the \xref{https://ldlt.digitallatin.org/}{Library of Digital Latin Texts}.\par
Students at the University of Pennsylvania transcribed and collated the manuscript witnesses and produced the text, critical apparatus, appendix critica, and translation. The contributors were undergraduates, students in the Postbac program, and graduate students in Classical Studies and Ancient History, along with some Philadelphia-area high school students: Adrienne Atkins, Katie Becker, Amelia Bensch-Schaus, Jacob Bickford, Nicholas Bolig, Victoria Burmeister, Sean Carpenter, Greg Callaghan, Brian Credo, Maxwell Dietrich, Alexis Frankel, Kathleen Garland, Nikola Golubovic, Wesley Hanson, Zachary Herbster, Xinyi Huang, Molly Hutt, Johanna Kaiser, Elizabeth Keyser, Scheherazade Khan, Peter Kotiuga, Maria Kovalchuk, Shenda Kuang, Amy Lewis, Scotland Long, Nicole Love, Daniel Mackey, Kate Murphy, Addie McKenzie, Theodora Naqvi, Jeffrey Nolte, Kristen Patterson, Marcie Persyn, Harrison Powell, Isaac Rand, Annamaria Rapsomanikis, Rudolf Rauk, Isabella Reinhardt, Joshua Renfro, Janelle Sadarananda, Jessica Shaw, Dallas Simons, Julia Simons, Brandon Stark, Benjamin Turnbull, Tom Vozar, Tim Warnock, Joseph Watkins, Duo Xu, Yingchao Zhu. You will find the names of some of these students in the edition itself as the sources of emendations to the text and authors of notes on difficult spots in the text. Special mention goes to: Sean Carpenter, who with the support of a grant from Penn’s Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program developed a transcription protocol compatible with automatic collation and produced directories of manuscript abbreviations; Dallas Simons, who helped edit the apparatus notes and prepared page images from early editions for Optical Character Recognition (one of those paths not yet taken, for which we also received help and advice from Greg Crane, Uwe Springmann, and Katie Rawson); Amy Lewis, who helped edit the apparatus notes and appendix critica; and Zachary Elliott, who along with his wife Molly Cowan tested approaches to automating the conversion of traditional apparatus notes into spreadsheet form. Support both financial and technical was provided by Penn’s \xref{https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/fellows/damon-cynthia}{Price Lab for Digital Humanities}.\par
We owe a debt of gratitude to many people at the University of Oklahoma. Virginia K. Felkner perfected the scripts used to reduce the amount of manual encoding we had to do. Mark Laufersweiler and Tyler Pearson of the Data Analytics, Visualization, and Informatics Syndicate provided invaluable advice on that and other aspects of the project. Tara Carlisle, Director of the Digital Scholarship Laboratory, facilitated meetings and made many helpful suggestions. Logan Cox made important contributions to the DLL's digital infrastructure. The Office of the Vice President for Research supported this and other DLL projects by providing physical and virtual spaces for them.\par
Several people beyond the walls of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma deserve special mention. Hugh Cayless (Duke University), co-author of the "\xref{https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html}{Guidelines for Encoding Critical Editions for the Library of Digital Latin Texts}" and architect of the application for reading this edition online, has been instrumental in all aspects of this project. Tom Elliott (New York University) and Alex Ward provided advice on scholarly and technical matters. Finally, this project could not have come to fruition without the support of the leadership of the Society for Classical Studies, particularly former Executive Director Adam Blistein and current Executive Director Helen Cullyer and those who have served as Vice President of Publications and Research during our work: Michael Gagarin, Donald Mastronarde, Kathryn Gutzwiller, and Colin Whiting.

\textit{This is a rendering by many hands, so it is stylistically uneven. The objective was to convey the meaning of the Latin syntax.} 
\newline
\pstart
\textbf{1} \textsuperscript{1}With the kindling of the Alexandrian War Caesar summoned his whole fleet from Rhodes and from Syria and Cilicia. He called up archers from Crete, cavalry from Malchus, king of the Nabataeans. He ordered siege engines to be collected from everywhere, grain to be sent, and reinforcements to be brought. \textsuperscript{2}In the meantime his fortifications were being strengthened every day with defensive works, and every part of the town that seemed to be less secure was being furnished with overhead shelters and covered galleries. Battering rams were carried from buildings into neighboring buildings through holes, and the fortifications were extended into all of the territory that was either cast down in ruins or taken by force. \textsuperscript{3}For Alexandria is mostly safe from fire, since the buildings lack wooden flooring and are held together by masonry and vaulted structures and covered with rubble and tiles. \textsuperscript{4}Caesar was particularly eager to close off part of the town—the part that a marsh coming in from the south made very narrow—from the rest of the city by employing defensive works and screens. \textsuperscript{5}His first expectation was that although the city had been divided into two parts his army would be managed according to one plan and authority, and then that it would be possible for support to be provided for his troops when they were struggling and for aid to be brought from the other part of the town, but especially that he would have an abundance of water and fodder. (He had a scanty supply of one of the two (sc. water), and no access at all to the other (sc. fodder).) As to which the marsh could bountifully supply each. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{2} \textsuperscript{1}As for the Alexandrians, however, they were subject to no hesitation or delay in conducting their business. For they had sent envoys and recruiting officers into every district—throughout the territory of Egypt and the kingdom—for conducting a levy, and they had brought a large number of weapons and siege engines into the town and had gathered a huge multitude. \textsuperscript{2}Plus, massive workshops of arms were set up in the city. In addition, they had armed the slaves of military age, and the wealthier masters provided these with sustenance and daily pay. \textsuperscript{3}The fortifications of the outlying parts of the town were guarded by an arrangement of this large force. They kept the veteran cohorts available in the most frequented areas of the city so that they could be deployed for bringing aid with fresh strength in whichever area there was fighting. \textsuperscript{4}They had blocked off all the roads and alleyways with a triple wall—it was built with square stones and was at least forty feet high—and fortified the lower parts of the city with very tall towers, each with ten stories. \textsuperscript{5}In addition, they had cobbled together moveable towers with the same number of stories. After mounting these on rollers, with ropes and pack animals †placed opposite†, they would move them on level streets into whichever part (sc. of the city) they wanted. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{3} \textsuperscript{1}The city, extremely abundant and well supplied, furnished all manner of provisions. The men themselves, clever and extremely keen, replicated with such ingenuity things they had seen made by us that our men seemed to have imitated their works, and they were discovering many things of their own accord and simultaneously attacking our fortifications and defending their own. \textsuperscript{2}Plus, their leaders kept pushing these points in councils and assemblies: that the Roman people gradually were coming into the habit of occupying the kingdom; that a few years prior Aulus Gabinius had been in Egypt with an army; that Pompey had withdrawn there in his flight; that Caesar had come with his troops, but that nothing had been accomplished by Pompey's death to deter Caesar from staying there; \textsuperscript{4}that if they did not drive him out, a province would come into being out of the kingdom, and that this must be done quickly. For Caesar, they said, shut off by storms because of the time of year, could not receive support from across the sea. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{4} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile a dispute had arisen between Achillas, who was in charge of the veteran army, and Arsinoe, the younger daughter of king Ptolemy, as was indicated above. Although each was plotting against the other and wanting to possess overall control, Arsinoe struck first through the eunuch Ganymede, her tutor, and killed Achillas. \textsuperscript{2}With him dead she began to take complete control without any partner or guardian. The army was handed over to Ganymedes. When he took up the office he increased the bounty for soldiers and managed the remaining tasks with equal diligence.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{5} \textsuperscript{1}Almost all of Alexandria has channels bored out beneath it, and it has conduits extending to the Nile (i.e., the Nile canal) through which water is led into private houses. And this (sc. water) gradually in an interval of time becomes clear and settles. \textsuperscript{2}It is this that owners of buildings and their households are accustomed to use. For that which is carried by the Nile River is so muddy and thick that it causes many different diseases. But the common people and the masses are necessarily content with it, since there are no fountains in the entire city. Nevertheless, the watercourse was in the part of the city controlled by the Alexandrians. \textsuperscript{3}Ganymedes was reminded by this fact that our men could be cut off from their water supply. These, distributed throughout the neighborhoods for the purpose of protecting the fortifications, were using water from private buildings drawn from conduits and wells. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{6} \textsuperscript{1}When this plan was approved he set about a great and difficult task. After having blocked all the conduits and closed off all the areas of the city that were occupied by him he strove to draw a huge amount of water from the sea with wheeled mechanisms. This (sc. water) he constantly poured from higher locations (i.e., from locations in the now blocked pipes that were below the blockage but above the private buildings' cisterns) into Caesar's territory. \textsuperscript{2}For this reason the water drawn from the closest buildings (i.e., those closest to the place(s) where sea water was injected into the system) was a little saltier than usual, and why this occurred was a source of great puzzlement for people. They did not really trust themselves, since people lower down said that they were using water of the same kind and flavor as they were accustomed to before, and they began making comparisons amongst themselves in public. And by tasting the waters they recognized how much the waters differed. \textsuperscript{3}But shortly thereafter the water that was closer (sc. to the place(s) where sea water was coming in) was wholly undrinkable and the lower water (i.e., the water in recipients that were further away) was now found to be more spoiled and saltier.

\textbf{7} \textsuperscript{1}And when, with this development, uncertainty was removed, so great a fear invaded that all felt themselves to have been brought to the brink of danger and some said that Caesar was delaying giving (i.e., was in no hurry to give) the order to embark, and others were much more seriously alarmed about their plight because, as they thought, it was not going to be possible to keep the Alexandrians ignorant while making preparations for a withdrawal, since they were separated from themselves by so little distance, nor was taking refuge on the ships going to be an option with the Alexandrians nearby and in pursuit. \textsuperscript{2}Moreover, there was a large crowd of townspeople in Caesar's district, whom he had not removed from their homes because they were making an open show of being loyal to our men and seemed to have cut their ties with their own side, so that I would have to defend the Alexandrians, saying that they are neither deceitful nor impetuous, and much verbiage would be spent to no purpose. \textsuperscript{3}But when their community and character are considered simultaneously, no one can doubt that this race is perfectly prepared for treachery.

\textbf{8} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar alleviated the fear of his men with reasoning and encouragement. He declared that if wells were dug fresh water could be found, as all shores naturally possess veins of fresh water. \textsuperscript{2}Even if the nature of the Egyptian shore was different from all the rest, he said, since they had freedom of movement on the sea and the enemy did not have a fleet, they could not be prevented from going after water with their ships daily, from either the left, from Paratonium, or the right, from the island, routes that, being different, were not going to be shut down by adverse winds at one and the same time. \textsuperscript{3}Retreat was certainly not in the plans, not only for those who considered their dignity of prime importance but not even for those who thought of nothing other than their own lives. \textsuperscript{4}Only with great difficulty were the enemy's frontal attacks being sustained from the fortifications. Once the fortifications were abandoned, they could not equal the enemy in position or number. \textsuperscript{5}Moreover, boarding the ships involved a long delay and great difficulty, especially from skiffs. The Alexandrians, by contrast, were possessed of the greatest mobility and knowledge of the positions and the buildings. \textsuperscript{6}These people, particularly insolent in the face of victory, would run ahead and gain possession of both the higher ground and the buildings. Thus they would prevent our men from fleeing in the ships. Accordingly, they should forget the idea and consider that they must win, whatever the cost.

\textbf{9} \textsuperscript{1}When he had made this speech to his men and everyone's spirits were roused he gave his centurions the assignment that pausing their work elsewhere they should concentrate on digging wells and not pause for any portion of the night. \textsuperscript{2}Once this assignment was taken in hand and the spirits of all were spurred on to exertion, in a single night a great quantity of fresh water was discovered. In this way the Alexandrians' laborious schemes and huge efforts were counteracted by a brief exertion. \textsuperscript{3}Two days later the thirty-seventh legion, made up of Pompeian troops who had surrendered, having been put onto ships by Domitius Calvinus with grain, arms, projectiles, and catapults, was conveyed to the shore of Africa somewhat beyond Alexandria. \textsuperscript{4}These ships were prevented from reaching the harbor by the East wind, which blew continuously for many days. However, locations throughout that region are excellent for holding anchors. Since they were detained in that place for a long time and oppressed by a shortage of water they made Caesar aware of their plight by means of a swift ship. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{10} \textsuperscript{1}In order to take consideration in person as to what seemed best to be done, Caesar boarded a ship and ordered the whole fleet to follow him—without, however, putting any of our soldiers on board, since, as he was going away for a rather long time, he did not want to leave the fortifications exposed. \textsuperscript{2}When they had approached the place that is called Chersonensus and had set the oarsmen on shore in order to fetch water, some of these, when they had advanced too far from the ships for the sake of plunder, were captured by the enemy cavalry. \textsuperscript{3}From these men they (i.e., the enemy) learned that Caesar himself had come with his fleet and that he did not have any soldiers on his ships. Once aware of this they came to believe that Fortune had bestowed upon them an opportunity for accomplishing a great success. \textsuperscript{4}Thus they equipped all the seaworthy ships they possessed with soldiers and fell in with Caesar as he was returning with his fleet. \textsuperscript{5}Caesar did not want to fight on that day for two reasons: first, he had no soldiers on his ships and then, the action itself was taking place after the tenth hour of the day. The night, however, would bring greater assurance to the enemy, it seemed, who trusted in their knowledge of the land. Furthermore, he would be bereft of the benefit of encouraging his troops, since no exhortation that could comment upon neither courage nor slackness would be sufficient to the purpose. \textsuperscript{6}For these reasons Caesar led back towards the land those ships that he could, to a place where he did not anticipate they would be followed.

\textbf{11} \textsuperscript{1}There was one Rhodian ship on Caesar's right wing in a position far from the rest. When the enemies saw this ship they did not restrain themselves, and with a concerted attack four decked and several open ships advanced against it. \textsuperscript{2}Caesar was compelled to give aid to the ship so as to avoid incurring a shameful insult in the sight of his own men. And yet he judged that if things ended rather badly for the (ship's) men the outcome would be deserved. \textsuperscript{3}The battle was waged with great exertion on the part of the Rhodians who, although they excelled in both skill and courage in every engagement, did not shrink from bearing the entire burden especially on that occasion to prevent people from thinking that any harm had been suffered by the fault of their men. \textsuperscript{4}Hence the battle turned into a great success. One of the enemy's quadriremes was captured, another was sunk, two were stripped of all their marines. Furthermore, a great multitude of soldiers in the remaining ships were slain. \textsuperscript{5}Had night not split up the battle, Caesar would have become master of the entire enemy fleet. \textsuperscript{6}While the enemies were thoroughly frightened by this injury, Caesar towed the transport ships to Alexandria against a gentle wind, with his own ships as victors.

\textbf{12} \textsuperscript{1}The Alexandrians were so crushed by this defeat, since they now saw themselves conquered not by the courage of the fighters but by the skill of the mariners, for whom both \gap{} in/from (?) the higher locations they were being supported, so that (?) they could be defended from the buildings and interposed all the wood as a barrier, because they feared an attack by our fleet even on land. \textsuperscript{2}The very same people, after Ganymedes assured them in council that he would both restore those (sc. ships) that had been lost and increase their number, began with great hope and confidence to repair the old ships and quite diligently to apply and devote themselves to this matter. \textsuperscript{3}And although they had lost more than a hundred and ten warships in the port and docks, nevertheless they did not discard the thought of repairing the fleet. \textsuperscript{4}For they saw that Caesar's reinforcements could not be brought (sc. to him), nor supplies, if they themselves prevailed with their fleet. In addition, as seafaring men belonging to a maritime city and region and trained in daily practice from boyhood, they wanted to take refuge in that natural and familiar advantage and perceived how much they had accomplished with very small vessels. And so they took to preparing the fleet with all zeal.

\textbf{13} \textsuperscript{1}Guards had been set up at all the mouths of the Nile for the sake of collecting customs fees and there were old ships in the hidden docks of the court, which they had not used for sailing for many years. The latter they restored, the former they recalled to Alexandria. \textsuperscript{2}Oars were lacking. They took the roofs off porticos, gymnasia, and public buildings and made use of the beams as oars. Their natural resourcefulness supplied one thing, the abundance of the city another. \textsuperscript{3}Finally, they were not preparing for a long voyage but serving the need of the present time and saw that the fighting would have to be done in the port itself. \textsuperscript{4}And so in a few days, contrary to everyone's opinion, they made twenty-two quadriremes and five quinqueremes. To these they added many smaller open boats, and after testing what each of them could do in the harbor by way of rowing they embarked suitable soldiers and outfited them completely for fighting. \textsuperscript{5}Caesar had nine Rhodian ships—for although ten had been sent one had foundered off the Egyptian coast en route—eight Pontic ships, five Lycian ships, and twelve from Asia. Of these ten were quinqueremes and quadriremes, the rest were smaller than this size and many of them open. \textsuperscript{6}Nevertheless, convinced of the courage of his soldiers and knowing the forces of the enemy he prepared to do battle.

\textbf{14} \textsuperscript{1}When it reached the point that each had confidence in his side, Caesar sailed around Pharos with his fleet and set his ships opposite the enemy. On the right wing he placed the men of Rhodes, on the left the men of Pontus. Between them he left a space of four hundred paces, which seemed to be enough for deploying up the ships. \textsuperscript{2}Behind this line he arranged the remaining ships as a reserve. He determined which should follow which and which should come to the aid of which, and gave the orders. \textsuperscript{3}Without hesitation the Alexandrians brought out and arranged their fleet for battle. In the front they placed 22 ships; they set up the rest as reserves in a second line. \textsuperscript{4}They also brought out a great number of smaller ships and skiffs with fire-darts (lit. with darts and fires), in case the multitude itself and the noise and flame could bring anything of terror to our men. \textsuperscript{5}Between the two fleets were shallows with a narrow passage. These extend toward the region of Africa. (For this is what they say, that half of Alexandria is part of Asia.). On both sides there was a rather long wait to see by which of the two the crossing would be initiated, since it seemed that those who entered, if the situation turned out worse for them, would be more impeded from deploying their ships and from retreating.

\textbf{15} \textsuperscript{1}Euphranor was in charge of the Rhodian ships, a man to be compared in his greatness of heart and his virtue more with our men than with the Greeks. \textsuperscript{2}He, on account of his very conspicuous knowledge and greatness of heart, was selected by the Rhodians to be in charge of the fleet. \textsuperscript{3}When he noticed the Caesar's \supplied{delay} he said, “You seem to me, Caesar, to be afraid that if you enter the shallows with your boats first, you will be forced to fight before you can deploy the rest of the fleet. Entrust the matter to us. \textsuperscript{4}We will endure the brunt of the battle — we will not disappoint your trust — until the others can follow us. For them to boast fr any longer in our sight is a source of great disgrace and pain for us.” \textsuperscript{5}Encouraging him and presenting him with all manner of praise Caesar gave the signal for battle. When four (sc. ships) had moved forward beyond the shallows, the Alexandrians surrounded the Rhodian ships and made an attack on them. \textsuperscript{6}They (sc. the Rhodians) stood firm and deployed themselves with skill and cunning. And their training was so effective that although the numbers were unequal no ship was exposed sideways to the enemy, no ship's oars were stripped off; in fact they (i.e., the Rhodians or the Rhodian ships) continually confronted those coming against them. \textsuperscript{7}Meanwhile the others followed. Then they necessarily departed from skill on account of the narrowness of the place and the whole struggle stood on virtue. \textsuperscript{8}Indeed there was no one in Alexandria, of our men or of the townspeople, \supplied{except} those concentrating on work or combat, who did not seek the highest roofs and from every viewpoint take a place for the spectacle and demand victory for their own side from the immortal gods with prayers and offerings.

\pstart
\textbf{16} \textsuperscript{1}The issue of contention, however, was not at all equal in the battle. For our men, once beaten back, had no escape route either by land or sea if defeated, and if they were victorious everything would remain unresolved. The enemy, if they had the advantage with their ships, would have power over everything, but if they proved weaker, would have other ways to try their luck (lit. would test the fortune that remained). \textsuperscript{2}At the same time it seemed distressing and miserable that a very few men were involved in a decisive fight about the bulk <of the army> and about the safety of everyone. If any one of them fell short in spirit or courage, the rest, who had had no opportunity of fighting for themselves, would have to look out. \textsuperscript{3}In the previous days Caesar had explained these things to his men repeatedly, so that they would fight with greater spirit because they saw that the safety of all had been entrusted to them. \textsuperscript{4}By the same argument each man, accompanying a messmate, friend, or companion, implored him not to disappoint his own opinion and that of everyone else, since their judgement was responsible for his being chosen and setting out to fight. \textsuperscript{5}And so they fought in such a frame of mind that skill and cunning brought no help to the Alexandrians, though they were sailors and seafarers, and the large number did not benefit those with a greater number of ships, and men chosen for their virtue from so great a multitude of men could not equal the virtue of our men. \textsuperscript{6}One quinquereme was taken in this battle and a bireme, with their fighters and rowers, and three were sunk, while all of ours were unharmed. \textsuperscript{7}The rest took flight to the nearby town. The (townspeople) protected them from the ramparts and overhanging buildings and prevented our men from going closer.

\pstart
\textbf{17} \textsuperscript{1}So that this could not happen to him repeatedly, Caesar thought that he ought to strive to bring the island and the jetty extending to the island into his power, whatever the cost. \textsuperscript{2}For since he had mostly completed his works in the town, he was confident that an attempt could be made on <both the latter> and the former at the same time. \textsuperscript{3}Having adopted this plan, he placed in small vessels and skiffs ten cohorts and the picked men belonging to his light-armed force and whichever of the Gallic horsemen he deemed suitable. On one side of the island <e.g., he landed his footsoldiers, on the other side> he attacked with decked ships in order to divide the (sc. enemy) forces, with great rewards offered to whoever seized the island first.  \textsuperscript{4}At first, equally matched, they withstood the attack of our men, for at the same moment they were both fighting back from the roofs of the buildings and mounting an armed defense of the shore—where on account of the difficulty of the location an easy approach was not given to our men—and nimbly and skillfully patrolling the position's narrows with their skiffs and five warships. \textsuperscript{5}But as soon as few of our men set foot on the shore, after getting to know the terrain and testing the shallows, and others followed these, and they made a resolute attack upon those who had taken a position on the level shore, all the men of Pharos turned their backs. \textsuperscript{6}With these men beaten back, \gap{} and with the guard of the port abandoned, they steered the ships toward the shore and the village and rushed forth from the ships to defend the buildings.

\pstart
\textbf{18} \textsuperscript{1}But they were unable to hold themselves within this defensive position for very long, even though the type of buildings was not dissimilar to those in Alexandria (to compare smaller things to greater), and lofty connecting tower blocks took the place of a wall, nor had our men come prepared with ladders or brushwood bundles or the remaining materials for making an assault. \textsuperscript{2}But fear seizes the mind and judgment from men and weakens their limbs. So it happened then. \textsuperscript{3}The same men who were confident that on a fair and level plain they were our equals, terrified by the flight of their men and the death of a few, did not dare make a stand in buildings with a height of 30 feet, and they threw themselves into the sea along the jetty and they swam the 800-pace distance to the town. \textsuperscript{4}Many of these men were nonetheless captured and killed, but the number of captives was 6,000 altogether.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{19} \textsuperscript{1}Letting the soldiers take the plunder, Caesar commanded that the buildings be ransacked and he fortified a stronghold near the bridge closer to Pharos and placed a garrison there. \textsuperscript{2}In their flight the men of Pharos had abandoned this bridge; as for the one that was more secure and closer to the city, the Alexandrians were guarding it. But on the next day Caesar attacked it for a similar reason, because he saw that, with these two under his control, naval sorties and sudden raids would be utterly out of the question. \textsuperscript{3}And using catapults and arrows from his ships he had already expelled those who were holding the place under their protection, driven them back into the town, and landed the equivalent of three cohorts. (For the tight quarters permitted no more to get themselves into position. The rest of his troops remained at their posts on the ships.) \textsuperscript{4}After accomplishing this he commanded that the bridge be fortified against the enemy and that where the ships had a way out—an arch had been built and the bridge was supported by it—the area be filled with rocks and blocked. \textsuperscript{5}With the one of these tasks completed, such that no skiff at all was able to get out, and with the other task begun, all of the Alexandrians' forces flung themselves out of the city and took a position in the wider area up against our bridge fortifications. At the same time they positioned the vessels that they had been in the habit of sending out through the bridges to burn our transports near the jetty. \textsuperscript{6}We were fighting from the bridge and jetty; they were fighting from the flat area facing the bridge and the ships alongside the jetty.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{20} \textsuperscript{1}With Caesar occupied in these matters and exhorting the troops, a great number of oarsmen and marines launched themselves from our warships onto the jetty. \textsuperscript{2}A portion of them were carried by an eagerness to watch, a portion even by a desire to fight. At first these repelled the enemy vessels from the jetty with stones and slings, and they seemed to be accomplishing much with the quantity of projectiles. \textsuperscript{3}But after a few Alexandrians dared to disembark from their ships beyond that point, on their open flank, our men, just as they had advanced without standards and fixed ranks, without order, in like manner they began to retreat rashly into the ships. \textsuperscript{4}More Alexandrians, spurred on by their flight, were disembarking from the ships and pursuing our men, whose dismay had intensified (OR, with Landgraf's emendation: starting a more aggressive pursuit of our men, who had been thrown into confusion). At the same time, those who had remained in the warships were hurrying to pull in the ladders and push the ships away from the shore to prevent the enemy from capturing the ships. \textsuperscript{5}Thrown into confusion by all of these events, our troops of the three cohorts that had been stationed on the bridge and the first part of the jetty, when they heard the clamor behind them, saw the flight of their own men, and faced a huge number of incoming projectiles, fearing lest they be surrounded in the rear and entirely cut off from retreat by the departure of the ships, abandoned the defenses begun on the bridge and with a great rush headed in agitation towards the ships. \textsuperscript{6}A portion of them, after reaching the nearest ships, were sunk by the multitude of men and their weight, a portion, pausing and hesitating over what plan should be taken, were killed by the Alexandrians. Some with a more fortunate outcome reached the unencumbered ships at anchor and escaped unharmed; a few, raising their shields and relying on an enterprising spirit, swam to nearby vessels. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{21} \textsuperscript{1}As long as Caesar was able by exhortation to keep his men at the bridge and defenses, he stayed on, sharing their danger (lit. was involved in the same danger). After he noticed that everyone was retreating, he withdrew himself into his own vessel. \textsuperscript{2}And when a great number of men following him there swarmed in, and no opportunity either of maneuvering or pushing back from the shore was given, suspecting that what did happen would happen he launched himself from the vessel and swam to the ships that were stationed further out. \textsuperscript{3}From there, sending skiffs to assist his struggling men, he saved some. As for his vessel, weighed down by the great number of men it perished together with the men. \textsuperscript{4}In this battle around 400 were lost from the number of the legionary troops and a slightly greater number of oarsmen and marines. \textsuperscript{5}The Alexandrians fortified a stronghold in that spot with substantial defenses and many siege engines, and after removing the rocks from the water they used the place freely afterwards for sending out vessels.

\pstart
\textbf{22} \textsuperscript{1}Our men were so far from being thrown into confusion by this defeat that, roused and provoked, they made extra efforts in attacking the enemy's fortifications. \textsuperscript{2}In the daily battles, whenever a chance had come their way, with the Alexandrians running forward and making sorties, \gap{} combat \gap{} to be checked †greatly† by fortifications and the burning eagerness of the soldiers. Nor was Caesar's widespread exhortation able to attain the level of the legions' effort or desire for fighting, so that they had to be deterred and restrained from exceptionally dangerous forms of combat rather than worked up for fighting.

\pstart
\textbf{23} \textsuperscript{1}The Alexandrians, since they saw that the Romans were both steadied by successes and spurred on by reverses, and since they did not know any third outcome of war by which they could become steadier themselves, as we are able to comprehend by conjecture, either having been advised by friends of the king who were inside Caesar's defenses, or with their own previously-made plan having been made acceptable to the king through secret messengers, they sent envoys to Caesar (saying that) he should release the king and allow him to cross over to his own people. \textsuperscript{2}For the whole multitude, they said, fed up with the girl's offensiveness, with a regent as ruler, and with Ganymedes' extremely cruel dominion, was prepared to do what the king ordered; and if they came into Caesar's trust and friendship by his authority, there would be no fear of any danger preventing the multitude from surrendering.

\pstart
\textbf{24} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar, although he knew well that the people were deceitful and always thinking something other than what they were pretending, nevertheless decided that there was utility in giving an indulgence to the petitioners. For he believed that the king would remain loyal after he was released if their feelings somehow accorded with what they were asking for, but that if they wanted to have the king as a leader for waging war (which was a better fit with their nature), it would be more splendid and honorable undertaking for him to wage war against a king rather than against a band of refugees and fugitives. \textsuperscript{2}Therefore, after urging the king to consider the interests of his ancestral kingdom, to spare \surplus{even} his most outstanding country, which had been disfigured by shameful conflagrations and demolitions, to recall his citizens to sanity and then preserve them, and to display his loyalty to the Roman people and to himself, since he (Caesar) believed in him so much that he sent him to armed enemies, grasping his right hand in his own right hand he began to dismiss the boy already an adult in age. \textsuperscript{3}But the royal spirit, educated in the most deceitful disciplines—and so that he would not fall short of the customs of his race—in tears began to beg Caesar instead not to send him away, saying that to him his very kingdom was not more pleasing than the sight of Caesar. \textsuperscript{4}After the boy's tears were suppressed an emotional Caesar, himself affirming that he (Ptolemy) would quickly be with him (Caesar) if he felt that way, dismissed him to his own people. \textsuperscript{5}As if released from from the starting gate onto an open track, Ptolemy began to wage so vigorous a war against Caesar that he seemed to have shed from joy the tears that he had produced in their meeting. \textsuperscript{6}Many legates, friends, officers, and soldiers of Caesar were glad that this had happened, because, as they thought, his excessive benevolence had been cheated by the deceits of a boy. As if in truth Caesar had done it led by generosity alone and not with a most prudent plan.

\pstart
\textbf{25} \textsuperscript{1}When the Alexandrians, after acquiring a leader, observed that they became no stronger nor did the Romans become more sluggish, and when, with the soldiers mocking the king's age and weakness, they took great offence and saw that they were not accomplishing anything, and when rumors arose that Caesar's substantial garrisons were being brought along the land route from Syria and Cilicia (a thing that had not yet been heard by Caesar), they decided to intercept the provisions that were being shipped for our men by sea. \textsuperscript{2}And so, with unencumbered vessels placed on duty in suitable places near Canopus, they began to lie in wait for our ships †supplies?†. \textsuperscript{3}When this was announced to Caesar, he commanded his whole fleet to be unencumbered and deployed. He placed Tiberius Nero in command of it (sc. the fleet). The Rhodian ships set out in this fleet, among them Euphranor, without whom no naval battle had ever—or even with inadequate success—been accomplished. \textsuperscript{4}But Fortune, who for the most part keeps those whom she has adorned with many favors for a harsher fall, pursued Euphranor unlike the Fortune of earlier occasions. \textsuperscript{5}For after they reached Canopus and the fleet deployed on each side had come to grips, and Euphranor, by his own custom, had been the first to engage and pierced through and sunk an enemy quadrireme, he, pursuing the next ship too far—since the rest were not following quickly enough—was surrounded by the Alexandrians. \textsuperscript{6}No one carried aid to him, either because they thought that there was enough protection for him because of his valor and luck or because they were afraid for their lives. So out of all in that battle the one man who conducted the affair well was the only one who perished, along with his victorious quadrireme.

\pstart
\textbf{26} \textsuperscript{1}Around the same time, Mithridates of Pergamum, a man of great prestige in Pergamum and of great wit and valor in war, and loyalty and dignity in his friendship with Caesar, having been sent into Syria and Cilicia at the start of the Alexandrian War for the sake of summoning reinforcements, with a great number of troops (which he had put together quickly thanks to both the most eager desire of the citizens and his own diligence), \textsuperscript{2}brought (sc. the troops) to Pelusium by a land route, where Egypt is joined with Syria. And as for this town, held by Achillas’ strong garrison because of the location’s convenience (for all Egypt is deemed to be fortified, as if by locks, with respect to naval attack by Pharos, with respect to land attack by Pelusium), Mithridates, having surrounded it suddenly with a great number of troops, although the multifarious garrison was fighting back stubbornly, brought it under his authority on the very day of the attack and installed his own garrison there, thanks to both the number of his own troops—he kept substituting intact troops for the wounded and the weary—and his perseverance and steadiness for fighting. \textsuperscript{3}Therefore, with this matter carried off well, he headed toward Alexandria, toward Caesar. And he had pacified all the areas through which he was making his way by the authority that is usually at hand for the victor, and had brought them into friendship with Caesar.

\textbf{27} \textsuperscript{1}There is a place not far from Alexandria, the most famous place of those regions, which is called the Delta. It took this name from its resemblance to the letter. For a certain portion of the Nile river, after a diversion, connects with the sea in two branches, gradually leaving a space in the middle between them, the branches being very far apart at the shore. \textsuperscript{2}Since the king learned that Mithridates was approaching this place and knew he must cross the river, he sent a large force against him, by which he believed Mithridates could be conquered or wiped out, or certainly detained. \textsuperscript{3}Although he desired that Mithridates be conquered, the king considered it sufficient that Mithridates be detained by him, cut off from Caesar. \textsuperscript{4}The first troops able to cross the river from the Delta and meet Mithridates started a battle, eager to deprive those who were following behind of a share of the victory. \textsuperscript{5}Mithridates withstood their attack with great prudence and steadfastness [of his virtues and the imprudence of the Alexandrians], his camp having been fortified according to our custom. But when he saw them approaching the fortifications recklessly and immoderately, he made sallies from every side and killed a great number of their men. \textsuperscript{6}If the rest had not hidden themselves, using their familiarity with the territory, and in part withdrawn into the ships they had used to cross the river, they would have been completely wiped out. \textsuperscript{7}When these men had revived themselves a little from that scare, they joined themselves to those who were following and began to attack Mithridates again.

\pstart
\textbf{28} \textsuperscript{1}A messenger was sent from Mithridates to Caesar in order to relate his success. The king learned about these same events from his own men. \textsuperscript{2}Thus at nearly the same time the king set out to crush Mithridates and Caesar to relieve him. The king used the quicker route by boat via the Nile river, in which he had a large fleet in readiness. Caesar was unwilling to use the same route, so as to avoid fighting a naval battle in the river, but taking a roundabout route by the sea that is said to belong to a part of Africa, as I explained above, he nonetheless fell in with the king's forces before the king could attack Mithridates, and welcomed a victorious Mithridates with his army intact. \textsuperscript{3}The king had encamped with his troops in a place with natural fortification, as it was in itself higher than the plain that lay beneath it on all sides. On three sides, moreover, it was protected by fortifications of different sorts: one side had been situated adjacent to the Nile river, another laid out in an extremely lofty position so that the position would constitute part of the stronghold, and the third was hemmed in by a swamp.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{29} \textsuperscript{1}Between the stronghold and Caesar’s route passed a narrow river with extremely high banks, which flowed into the Nile. It was about seven miles distant from the king’s stronghold. \textsuperscript{2}When the king learned that Caesar was coming by that route, he sent his entire cavalry and select light infantry to that river; they were to prevent Caesar from crossing and engage from the banks in a lop-sided long-range battle: for courage made no headway and cowardice met with no danger. \textsuperscript{3}This situation inflamed our soldiers and cavalry with resentment that the contest with the Alexandrians was lasting so long in an indecisive battle. \textsuperscript{4}Thus, at the same moment a portion of the German cavalry, after scattering in search of fords, swam across the river where the banks were rather low, and the legions, after cutting down huge trees that were long enough to touch both banks, toppling them forward and piling on a makeshift roadbed, crossed the river. \textsuperscript{5}The enemy was so utterly terrified of their attack that they set their hopes of safety on flight. Yet this was in vain, for a few from that flight made it back to the king, while all the remaining multitude was slain.

\pstart
\textbf{30} \textsuperscript{1}After this most notable success Caesar, since he thought that his sudden approach would strike great terror into the Alexandrians, immediately pushed forward as a victor to the king's camp. \textsuperscript{2}But when he observed that this (camp) was surrounded by a substantial fortification and protected by the nature of its position, and saw the dense mass of armed men stationed on the rampart, he was unwilling to have his soldiers, weary with marching and fighting, move up to attack the camp. Therefore, he pitched camp, leaving no great distance (between it and) the enemy. \textsuperscript{3}On the following day, Caesar attacked and took the fort that the king had built in the nearest village not far distant from his own stronghold and joined to the its fortification by means of outworks so as to hold onto the village. Caesar used all of his forces, not because he thought it would be difficult to accomplish this by using a smaller number of soldiers, but so that, with the Alexandrians thoroughly unnerved by that victory, he could attack the king's stronghold directly. \textsuperscript{4}And so the soldiers pursued the Alexandrians retreating from the fort into the stronghold at a run, and without stopping moved up to the fortifications and began to fight an extremely fierce long-range battle. \textsuperscript{5}Our men had an approach for attack from two areas: one, which I explained had an unencumbered approach, the other, which had a moderate-sized space between the stronghold and the river Nile. \textsuperscript{6}The largest and most carefully picked contingent of the Alexandrians was defending the area that afforded the easiest approach, but the men who were fighting near the river Nile were having the most success in repelling and wounding our men. For our men were being pierced by projectiles from different directions, from the front by projectiles coming from the stronghold's rampart, from the rear by projectiles coming from the river, on which many ships manned with slingers and archers were attacking our men.

\textbf{31} \textsuperscript{1}When Caesar saw that his soldiers could fight no more vigorously, and yet that little headway was being made owing to the difficulty of their positions, and when he noticed that the Alexandrians had neglected their stronghold's most elevated position both because it provided its own defense and because, in their eagerness in some cases to fight, in others to look on, the men had rushed down to the position in which there was fighting, he ordered three cohorts to encircle the stronghold and to attack the most elevated position, and he put Carfulenus in command of them, a man outstanding in both greatness of spirit and knowledge of military affairs. \textsuperscript{2}Upon their arrival, with a small number defending the fortifications while our men fought with extreme vigor, the Alexandrians, terrified by the noise and the fighting in a new location, began to scatter in a panic into every part of the stronghold. \textsuperscript{3}The spirits of our men were so incited by the enemy's confusion that they captured positions at nearly the same time from all directions, the stronghold's highest point, however, first. Running down from that point our men killed a great multitude of the enemy in the stronghold. \textsuperscript{4}Many Alexandrians fleeing this danger hurled themselves en masse from the rampart into the area that was joined to the river. \textsuperscript{5}The first of these were crushed in a great heap right in the fortification's trench, and then the rest had an easier escape. \textsuperscript{6}It is agreed that the king himself fled from the camp and then, after being received aboard ship, perished when the vessel was sunk by the large number of men who were swimming to the nearest ships.

\pstart
\textbf{32} \textsuperscript{1}This affair was conducted with the utmost success and rapidity, and thereafter Caesar, with the confidence arising from a great victory hastened with his cavalry to Alexandria by the nearest overland route and entered as victor through the quarter of the town that was in the hands of the enemy garrison. \textsuperscript{2}His plan proved completely correct: after hearing about the battle the enemy was no longer going to contemplate war. \textsuperscript{3}Upon arrival he gained a fitting return for valour and magnanimity, for the entire population of townsfolk threw down their weapons and abandoned their fortifications. Then, after donning the attire in which suppliants customarily placate rulers with prayers and bringing out all the sacred emblems by whose sanctity they were accustomed to entreat the offended and angry hearts of their kings, they hastened to Caesar as he arrived and surrendered themselves to him. \textsuperscript{4}Caesar took them under his protection and consoled them, then went through the enemy fortifications into his own part of the town greatly cheered by his own men, who were happy about the good fortune not only of the war itself and the fighting but also of the way he arrived (in Alexandria). [According to Orosius, 6.16.1, there were 12,000 prisoners of war and 70 captured ships.]

\textbf{33} \textsuperscript{1}Having made himself master of Egypt and Alexandria, Caesar appointed as rulers those whom Ptolemaeus had written down in his will and entreated the Roman people that they not be changed. \textsuperscript{2}For since the elder of the two boys, the king, was gone, Caesar handed over the kingdom to the younger one and to the elder of the two daughters, Cleopatra, who had remained under his protection and within his defenses; the younger daughter, Arsinoe—I showed earlier that Ganymedes long ruled immoderately in her name—he decided to remove from the realm, lest some new dissension arise again at the instigation of turbulent men, before the dominion of the rulers was consolidated by the passage of time. \textsuperscript{3}As for the legions, taking the veteran Sixth taken away with him he left the rest there, so that the dominion of these rulers would be more stable, rulers who could enjoy neither the affection of their people, because they had remained faithfully in the friendship of Caesar, nor the authority of a long-established reign, having been in place as rulers for a small number days. \textsuperscript{4}At the same time he deemed it relevant to the dignity of our empire and to public expediency that, if the rulers remained loyal, they be protected by our garrisons; if they were ungrateful, they could be held in check by those same garrisons. Thus with all these things completed and put in place, he (Caesar) himself set out by way of land into Syria.

\pstart
\textbf{34} \textsuperscript{1}While these events took place in Egypt, King Deiotarus came to Domitius Calvinus, to whom Caesar had given Asia and the nearby provinces to be governed, to beg him not to allow Lesser Armenia, his own kingdom, or Cappadocia, the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, to be possessed and destroyed by Pharnaces, (saying that) unless they (i.e., the kings) were freed from this evil, they were unable to do what had been ordered and to pay the money promised to Caesar. \textsuperscript{2}Domitius, since he not only deemed that money was necessary for settling military expenses but also determined that it was a shameful thing for the Roman people and for victorious C. Caesar and a disreputable thing for himself that the kingdoms of allies and friends be occupied by a foreign king, immediately sent messengers to Pharnaces, (ordering him) to withdraw from Armenia and Cappadocia and not to test the strength of the right and majesty of the Roman people in the circumstance of civil war. \textsuperscript{3}Since he thought that this warning was going to have greater force if he approached those regions more closely with his army, having set out to the legions he led one of three, the Thirty-Sixth, with him, sent to Caesar in Egypt the two summoned in Caesar's letters. (One of these did not arrive in the Alexandrian war, because it had been sent by a terrestrial route through Syria.) \textsuperscript{4}Cn. Domitius added to the Thirty-Sixth legion two from Deiotarus that he had built up with our discipline and armament for many years, plus 100 horsemen, and took the same number from Ariobarzanes. \textsuperscript{5}He sent P. Sestius to the quaestor C. Plaetorius, (ordering him) to lead the legion that had been formed out of hastily raised soldiers in Pontus, and Quintus Patisius to Cilicia for the purpose of summoning reinforcements. All these forces quickly assembled in Comana (i.e., Comana Pontica) by the order of Domitius.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{35} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile the ambassadors brought back replies from Pharnaces: that he had withdrawn from Cappadocia but retaken Lesser Armenia, which he ought to possess by right, on his father's account. Finally, the matter of that kingdom should be preserved untouched for Caesar. For he (Pharnaces) was ready to do what he (Caesar) had decided. \textsuperscript{2}Since [P.] Domitius noted that Pharnaces had withdrawn from Cappadocia motivated not by free choice but by necessity, because he was able (he believed) to defend Armenia, adjacent to his own kingdom, more easily than the more remote Cappadocia, and because he had thought that Domitius was going to bring along all three legions, and had remained quite audaciously in Armenia once he (Pharnaces) realized that two of these had been sent to Caesar, he (Domitius) began to insist that he (Pharnaces) withdraw from that kingdom, too. For his right to Cappadocia, Domitius said, was no different than his right to Armenia, nor was there justification for his demand that the matter be left untouched for the arrival of Caesar, for something was "untouched" if it was the same as it had been. \textsuperscript{3}With these replies having been given, Domitius set out into Armenia with the forces that I recorded above, and he began to make a journey via higher ground. (For leaving Pontus by way of Comana <there is> an elevated, wooded ridge stretching into Lesser Armenia, and this ridge forms the boundary separating Cappadocia from Armenia.) And <it is agreed> that these are the indubitable advantages of this route: the fact that on higher ground no sudden attack of enemies could occur, and the fact that Cappadocia, adjacent to these ridges, was going to supply a great abundance of provision(s).

\pstart
\textbf{36} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile Pharnaces sent several embassies to Domitius to negotiate about peace and bear the king's gifts to Domitius. \textsuperscript{2}He (sc. Domitius) kept rejecting all these things firmly and responding to the ambassadors that nothing was going to be more important to him than recovering the dignity of the Roman people and the kingdoms of the allies. \textsuperscript{3}With long and uninterrupted marches having been completed, when he arrived at Nicopolis—this town located in Lesser Armenia was itself in a level place, but with high mountains as barriers on two sides at a significant remove from the town—he pitched his camp around 7 miles away from Nicopolis. \textsuperscript{4}Since a narrow and obstructed place had to be traversed (sc. by anyone approaching Nicopolis) from this camp, Pharnaces set selected infantry and almost all his cavalry in an ambush. Moreover, he ordered a large quantity of livestock to be scattered within the pass and the peasants and townsfolk to linger in these places, \textsuperscript{5}so that, whether Domitius traversed this narrow spot as friend or enemy, he would have no suspicion of an ambush when he noticed that both livestock and men were moving about in the fields as if at the arrival of friends, or, if he came as if into enemy territory, his soldiers would be scattered in plundering booty and slaughtered piecemeal. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{37} \textsuperscript{1}Although he was conducting these operations, Pharnaces nevertheless continued to send legates to Domitius concerning peace and friendship, because he believed that by this very strategy Domitius could be more easily deceived. \textsuperscript{2}Conversely, the hope of peace gave Domitius cause for delaying in the same camp (i.e., for staying where he was, about 7 miles from Nicopolis). Thus Pharnaces, once the opportunity of the most recent moment had been lost, because he feared that his ambush might be made known, recalled his men into the camp. \textsuperscript{3}On the following day Domitius approached nearer to Nicopolis and set up camp near town. While our troops strengthened this camp, Pharnaces arrayed his battle line according to his custom and habit. \textsuperscript{4}For with the battle line drawn as a single straight line in the front, the wings were strengthened by three reserves each. Following the same rationale these (i.e., three-fold reserves) were positioned in the middle of his battle line, with single lines arrayed in the two intervals to the right and left (sc. of the middle of the line). \textsuperscript{5}Domitius finished the work that had been started on the camp, with part of his troops having been stationed in front of the rampart.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{38} \textsuperscript{1}The next night Pharnaces, with messengers having been intercepted who were carrying letters to Domitius concerning the affairs of Alexandria, learned that Caesar was situated in great danger and that it was being demanded of Domitius that he send reinforcements to Caesar as soon as possible and that he himself advance closer to Alexandria through Syria. \textsuperscript{2}With this having been learned, Pharnaces reckoned it to be tantamount to victory if he was able to drag out the time, because he thought that it was necessary for Domitius to decamp quickly. \textsuperscript{3}Thus where he thought there was the easiest approach from the town and most advantageous location for our men for waging battle, he extended two straight trenches, four feet in depth, with a not particularly large space having been left between them, to the place beyond which he had determined not to extend his line. \textsuperscript{4}He always drew up his battle line between these trenches; he stationed his entire cavalry, however, beyond the trench on the sides. They were going to be able to be useful in no other way and surpassed our cavalry by a great number. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{39} \textsuperscript{1}Domitius, however, because he was disturbed more by Caesar's danger than his own and judged that he would not safely break camp if he sought again the terms that he had rejected or departed without cause, led the army out of the nearby camp and into battle formation. \textsuperscript{2}He stationed the thirty-sixth legion on the right wing, the Pontic legion on the left. He moved the legions of Deiotarus together into the middle of the line—but he nevertheless left them a very narrow section of the front—with the remaining cohorts positioned as reserves. With the battle line on both sides having been drawn up thus there was an advance for the purpose of fighting.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{40} \textsuperscript{1}With the signal having been given on both sides at the same time there was a charge. The fighting was fierce and various. For the thirty-sixth legion, after it made an attack beyond the trench against the cavalry of the king, waged so successful a battle as to come under the walls of the town, cross the trench, and attack the enemy from behind. \textsuperscript{2}But on the other side the Pontic legion, when it had withdrawn a small distance facing the enemies but had tried to circumvent and get across the trench so that it could attack the enemy on its open flank, was stopped and overwhelmed in very act of crossing the trench. The legions of Deiotarus, however, barely withstood the attack. \textsuperscript{3}Thus the royal forces, victorious on his right wing and in the middle of the line, turned themselves toward the thirty-sixth legion. This nevertheless withstood the attack of the victors bravely. Surrounded by a great mass of foes, fighting with great resolution, (the legion) drew itself into a circle near the base of the mountains, where Pharnaces did not wish to follow owing to the location's unfavorable nature. \textsuperscript{4}Thus with the Pontic legion having been almost completely lost, and with a great part of Deiotarus’ soldiers having been killed, the thirty-sixth legion took themselves to a higher location with no more than two hundred and fifty having been lost. \textsuperscript{5}Some distinguished and illustrious men died in this battle, Romans of equestrian status. After incurring such a setback Domitius nevertheless gathered the remains of (his) scattered army and withdrew them into Asia through Cappadocia by safe roads.

\pstart
\textbf{41} \textsuperscript{1}Pharnaces, carried away by his successes, since he was hoping that what he wanted concerning Caesar (would occur), occupied Pontus with all his forces. And there, acting as both a conqueror and an exceptionally cruel king, since he was set on (having) his paternal holdings with a more prosperous outcome, he laid waste to many towns, plundered the goods of both Roman and Pontic citizens, \textsuperscript{2}established tortures in regards to those who had something commendable of beauty and age, those (tortures) that were more pitiable than death. And since no one defended Pontum, he began to hold it, boasting that he had retaken his paternal kingdom.

\pstart
\textbf{42} \textsuperscript{1}Around that same time a setback occurred in Illyricum. This province had been held in the preceding months not only without disgrace but even with praise. \textsuperscript{2}Moreover, Quintus Cornificius, a quaestor of Caesar’s with propraetorian powers, having been sent to this province in the summer with two legions, even though the province was minimally stocked for sustaining armies and had been exhausted and laid waste by the nearby war and rebellions, nevertheless with his foresight and attentiveness—since he took great care that he not advance rashly anywhere—both reclaimed and defended \surplus{it}. \textsuperscript{3}For instance, he stormed numerous strongholds positioned in elevated locales, the advantageousness of which kept encouraging the stronghold commanders to execute raids and undertake military campaigns, and presented his soldiers with the booty (which, even if meagre, was nevertheless appreciated, so great was the desperation of the province, especially since the booty had been acquired through valor). And when Octavius, after the flight that followed the battle of Pharsalus, arrived in that area with a great fleet, Cornificius had gained possession of Octavius' scattered ships using a few ships of the Iadertini, a people whose singular service to the state had remained firm. The result was that, with these ships added to those of his allies, he was able to contend in battle with something akin to a fleet. \textsuperscript{4}When, Caesar, the victor, was pursuing Cn. Pompeius in the most extreme opposite part of the earth and heard that numerous adversaries, after collecting those left after the flight, had arrived in Illyricum, owing to its proximity to Macedonia, he sent a message to Gabinius, [bidding him] that he set out with his legions of recruits, which had been conscripted just recently, for Illyricum. After joining his forces with Q. Cornificus, he was to dispel any danger inflicted on the province; if, however, the province could not be secured with forces that were not large, he was to lead his legions into Macedonia. \textsuperscript{5}For Caesar believed that the entire area and region would revive the war, so long as Cn. Pompeius was alive.

\pstart
\textbf{43} \textsuperscript{1}When Gabinius came to Illyricum during the wintry and difficult time of the year, whether thinking that the province was more fully stocked, or attributing a great deal to the luck of the victorious Caesar, or confident in his own courage and expertise (having often taken risks with this in his wars, he had executed great successes under his own leadership and auspices), he neither derived support from the resources of the province, which had become desolate in some parts, unreliable in others, nor had the ability to convey provisions, the sea being closed to ships by storms, and under the constraint of great difficulties he waged the war not as he wished, but as was necessary. \textsuperscript{2}Thus, when he was forced to raid towns or strongholds in the most extreme weather on account of his shortage of supplies, he repeatedly suffered misfortunes and was regarded by the locals with such contempt that, while retreating to the coastal town, Salona, whose inhabitants were exceptionally brave and loyal Roman citizens, he was forced to engage in battle on the march. \textsuperscript{3}After losing more than two thousand infantrymen, thirty-eight centurions, five tribunes in this battle, he retreated with the rest of his forces to Salona and, under pressure from extreme difficulty in everything, within a few months passed away there from illness. And both his ill-luck while alive and his sudden death gave Octavius much hope of acquiring the province. As for him, however, both luck, a most potent factor in wars—along with the diligence of Cornificius—and the bravery of Vatinius did not allow him a very long involvement in success.

\textbf{44} \textsuperscript{1}When Vatinius was in Brundisium, after having learned of the things that took place in Illyricum, since he was being summoned by Cornificius' frequent letters to provide aid to the province, and since he was hearing that Marcus Octavius had made pacts with the barbarians and in many places was attacking the garrisons of our soldiers partly in person with a fleet, partly with infantry forces through the agency of barbarians, and although, being affected by poor health, in bodily strength he could barely keep up with his spirit, he nevertheless overcame with his courage the disadvantage of nature and the difficulties of both the winter and the hasty preparation. \textsuperscript{2}For since he had few warships in the harbor, he sent a letter to Achaia to Quintus Calenus asking that he send a fleet to him. \textsuperscript{3}Since this was happening later than the danger in which our men found themselves demanded—they were not able to fend off the attack of Octavius—he mounted beaks on the swift ships, whose number was quite large but whose bulk was by no means appropriate enough for fighting. \textsuperscript{4}He added these to the warships and, having increased the fleet's numerical strength by putting veteran soldiers on board (he had a great number of these from all the legions, who had been left behind among the sick in Brundisium when his army was being transported to Greece), he set out to Illyricum. \surplus{There} he took back a few coastal towns that had revolted and surrendered themselves to Octavius, and others, which remained adamant in their decision, he sailed past, and he did not bring upon himself a delay and exigency for any reason that might prevent him from pursuing Octavius himself as quickly as possible. \textsuperscript{5}With his arrival he forced Octavius, who was attacking Epidaurus, where a garrison of ours was, by land and sea, to disengage the attack, and he took back our garrison.

\pstart
\textbf{45} \textsuperscript{1}When Octavius learned that Vatinius had a navy largely composed from small ships built for speed, being confident in his own navy he stopped at the island of Tauris. Vatinius, in pursuit, was sailing in this area, not because he knew that Octavius had stopped there, but rather because he had decided to follow him after Octavius had gone some distance ahead. \textsuperscript{2}When Vatinius came closer to Tauris (keeping his ships at a distance from one another since the weather was stormy and there was no suspicion of the enemy) he all of a sudden spotted a ship sailing his way, with the yards lowered to mid-mast and equipped with soldiers. \textsuperscript{3}When he noticed this, he quickly ordered that the sails be reefed, the yards be lowered, and that the soldiers arm themselves. Having raised the banner with which he was accustomed to give the battle-sign, he started signaling that the ships that were right behind him do the same thing. \textsuperscript{4}Vatinius’ soldiers began preparing themselves under sudden pressure. Octavius’ soldiers, already prepared, set forth from the harbor one after another. A battle line forms on both sides: that of Octavius with a more orderly arrangement, that of Vatinius better equipped in terms of soldiers’ morale.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{46} \textsuperscript{1}Although Vatinius realized that he was inferior both with regards to the ships’ size and their number, he preferred to entrust the matter to a chance engagement. Thus, he attacked first, driving his quinquereme against the quadrireme of Octavius himself. \textsuperscript{2}As Octavius was rowing against him with utmost speed and bravery, the opposing ships rushed together with their beaks clashing so furiously that the ship of Octavius, her beak shattered, was trapped in the timber. \textsuperscript{3}The battle was going on fiercely elsewhere as well, and there was a rush towards the leaders especially. Since everyone was coming to his own leader’s aid, a large battle developed at close quarters in the narrow strait of the sea. \textsuperscript{4}The more opportunity for combat was given, once the ships had come together, the greater the superiority of Vatinius' soldiers. With admirable boldness they were not hesitating to jump over from their vessels onto enemy ships, and, once the engagement was brought to equal terms, being by far superior in bravery, they began to fight with success. \textsuperscript{5}The quadrireme of Octavius himself sank, while many other ships were captured or sunk after being punctured by beaks. The soldiers of Octavius were partly slaughtered on the ships, partly toppled into the sea. \textsuperscript{6}Octavius himself boarded a skiff. And when many boarded it in flight—the skiff having sunk—Octavius, although wounded, managed to swim to his little pirate vessel. \textsuperscript{7}Being taken in there, when the night had dispersed the battle, he escaped by sail in a large storm. A few of his ships that chance had spared from the disaster followed him.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{47} \textsuperscript{1}But Vatinius, with the affair having been carried off well, sounded a retreat and, as victor, withdrew himself with all of his men uninjured into the port from which Octavius’ fleet had gone forward for the purpose of fighting. \textsuperscript{2}From that battle he gained possession of one penteris, two triremes, eight two-banked galleys, and several of Octavius’ oarsmen. And after spending the following day there while repairing his own and the captured ships, two days later he hastened to the island of Issa, because he believed that Octavius had withdrawn himself there in flight. \textsuperscript{3}On the island there was a town, the most famous of those regions and thoroughly tied to Octavius. \textsuperscript{4}And when Vatinius arrived there the townsfolk gave themselves up as suppliants to Vatinius, and he learned that Octavius himself, the wind being favorable, had made for the region of Greece with a few small ships, so that from there he might head for Sicily and then Africa. \textsuperscript{5}Thus, in a short space, with the affair having been conducted most brilliantly, with the province having been regained and returned to Cornificius, with the fleet of the enemy having been expelled from that entire zone, he, as victor, withdrew himself to Brundisium with his army and fleet uninjured.

\pstart
\textbf{48} \textsuperscript{1}However, at the times in which Caesar was besieging Pompey at Dyrrachium and was conducting things successfully at Palaepharsalus and was fighting at Alexandria not only with great danger but also with a greater rumor of danger, Quintus Cassius Longinus, having been left behind in Spain as the propraetor for the sake of holding the further province, owing either to the habit of his nature or to the animosity towards that province that he had adopted as a quaestor after he was wounded there in an ambush, had created significant additions of animosity against himself—and he could have learned of it either from self-awareness, since he believed the province's feelings about him to be reciprocal, or from the many indications and testimonies of those who had difficulty disguising their hatred—and desired to counterbalance the hatred of the province with the affection of the army. \textsuperscript{2}Accordingly, as soon as he assembled the army into one place, he promised one hundred sesterces each to the soldiers, and not long after, when in Lusitania he had captured the town of Medubriga and Mount Herminius, to which the Medubrigensians had fled, and he was addressed as imperator there, he presented the soldiers with one hundred sesterces each. \textsuperscript{3}Moreover, he granted many and great rewards to individuals, which put on display his love of the army at present. However, little by little and secretly he was diminishing military discipline and strictness.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{49} \textsuperscript{1}Having established the legions in their various winter quarters, Cassius went to Corduba for the purpose of hearing legal cases, and he decided to pay off debt contracted in the province by means of extremely heavy burdens on the province. And as the custom of largesse demands, the specious pretext of generosity was used, but the intended beneficiary of the majority of the requests was the donor. \textsuperscript{2}Funds were requisitioned from the wealthy, and Longinus not only permitted but even forced these to be set down for him (i.e., in his account books) as expenditures. At this same time frivolous lawsuits, too, were launched against the crowd of wealthy men, and no kind of profit, either great and apparent or small and sordid, was neglected, such that the commander’s residence and tribunal were uninvolved with it. \textsuperscript{3}No one who could make at least some outlay was not either constrained by a guarantee or listed among the accused. Thus great anxiety about personal peril, too, was added to expenses and damage to family fortunes. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{50} \textsuperscript{1}For these reasons it happened that, when Longinus did the same thing as commander that he had done as quaestor, the provincials again initiated similar plans about killing him. \textsuperscript{2}Several members of his inner circle intensified the provincials' hatred. These, although they were involved in that notorious partnership in theft, nevertheless hated the man in whose name they were committing crimes, and were in the habit of crediting to themselves whatever they had seized and assigning to Cassius whatever sums were due for payment or subject to claims. \textsuperscript{3}He enrolled a new fifth legion. The hatred grew from the conscription itself and from the expense of the additional legion. A contingent of three thousand cavalrymen was filled and equipped at very great expense. And the province was given no repose.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{51} \textsuperscript{1}In the meantime, he received a letter from Caesar, saying that he should transfer his army to Africa and should go through Mauretania to the borders of Numidia because it was thought that Iuba had sent substantial reinforcements for Gnaeus Pompeius and was about to send more. \textsuperscript{2}After he had received the letter he was animated by uncharacteristic readiness because, as he saw it, so great an opportunity—in the form of new provinces and an extremely fertile kingdom—had been offered to him. \textsuperscript{3}Because of this, he himself left for Lusitania in order to summon legions and to gather auxiliary troops. To certain people he gave the task that grain and a hundred ships should be prepared and that monetary contributions should be defined and requisitioned so that nothing would be delayed when he returned. \textsuperscript{4}For neither effort nor watchfulness were missing in Cassius, especially when he wanted something.

\pstart
\textbf{52} \textsuperscript{1}After the army was collected in a single place and the camp had been set up near Cordoba, he explained in front of the assembly of soldiers what things he was obliged to carry out on Caesar’s command, and he promised them, when he had transferred them to Mauretania, to give each 100 sesterces. The fifth legion, he said, would stay in Spain. \textsuperscript{2}After the assembly he returned to Cordoba and on the very same day in the afternoon, when he was going to the basilica, a certain Minucius Silon, a client of Lucius Racilius, gave him a petition, as if he was demanding something from him in the manner of a soldier. Then, when Silon had insinuated himself behind Racilius (for he covered one side of Cassius) as if he was seeking an answer—room had quickly been made for him—he grabbed Cassius, who was facing away from him, with his left hand and with his right struck him twice with a dagger. \textsuperscript{3}As a clamor arose there was an attack by all of the conspirators. Munatius Flaccus stabbed the nearest attendant with his sword. After this one was killed, he injured the officer Quintus Cassius. \textsuperscript{4}At that point Titus Vasius and Marcus Mercello with similar audacity helped their townsman Flaccus. For they were all from Italica. But Lucius Licinius Squillus rushed up to Longinus himself and wounded him lying there with light blows.

\pstart
\textbf{53} \textsuperscript{1}People rushed together to defend Cassius. For he was always accustomed to have an armed escort of Berones and numerous veterans. \textsuperscript{2}By those the rest of the people who were following to participate in the massacre were excluded. In this group were Calpurnius Salvianus and Manilius Tusculus. \textsuperscript{3}Minucius was overpowered while fleeing among the outcrops on the route, and after Cassius had been carried back to his house he was taken to him. Racilius moved to the adjacent house of a friend until he could learn with certainty that Cassius had been finished off. \textsuperscript{4}Laterensis hurried to the camp happy, since he had no doubt about it, and congratulated soldiers of the indigenous and second legions, whom he knew to be particularly hostile to Cassius. He was raised up onto the tribunal by the crowd and declared praetor. \textsuperscript{5}For nobody either born in the province, like the soldiers of the indigenous legion, or effectively provincial from their long stay (in this number was the second legion), did not agree with the entire province in their hatred for Cassius. As for the 30th and 21st legions, Caesar had assigned them to Longinus after enrollment in Italy a few months earlier. The fifth legion had recently been assembled there (sc. in Spain).

\textbf{54} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile, notice was brought to Laterensis that Cassius was alive. Laterensis, being more moved by sorrow than unsettled at this news, revived himself quickly and set out to visit Cassius. \textsuperscript{2}Upon learning about this matter the 30th legion took its standards to Corduba to bring help to its commander. The 21st did the same. The 5th followed them. \textsuperscript{3}When two legions were left in the camp, the soldiers of the second legion, fearing lest they be left solitary and lest it become evident from that what their feelings (sc. about the matter) were, followed the lead of the previous ones. The indigenous legion remained steadfast in its opinion and was not moved from its position by any fear.

\pstart
\textbf{55} \textsuperscript{1}Cassius ordered those who were named as accomplices to the murder to be seized. Keeping 30 cohorts, he sent the fifth legion back to camp. \textsuperscript{2}From Minucius' evidence he learned that Lucius Racilius, Lucius Laterensis, and Annius Scapula, a provincial of the highest standing and influence and as closely connected to himself as Laterensis and Racilius, had taken part in the same conspiracy (sc. as Minucius), and he did not detain his sorrow for long before he ordered them to be killed. \textsuperscript{3}He handed over Minucius to his freedmen to be tortured, likewise Calpurnius Salvianus, who gave evidence and increased the number of conspirators—truthfully, as some think, but as others protest, under compulsion. Lucius Mercello was subjected to the same tortures. \textsuperscript{4}Squillus named many. And Cassius ordered them to be killed, except those who redeemed themselves with a fine. \textsuperscript{5}For he openly agreed upon six million sesterces with Calpurnius and five million with Quintus Sestius, men who, although extremely guilty, were fined. Nevertheless, the fact that the danger to his life and the pain of his wounds had been discharged for a fine signified that his cruelty had contended with his greed.

\pstart
\textbf{56} \textsuperscript{1}A few days later he (sc. Cassius) received a letter sent by Caesar from which he learned that Pompey, defeated in battle and having lost his troops, had fled. \textsuperscript{2}Upon learning this he experienced pleasure mixed with resentment. The news of victory elicited joy [or? In announcing the victory he expressed joy?], but the conclusion of the war put an end to the lax discipline of the times. So uncertain was his mind as to whether it preferred to fear nothing or to be permitted everything. \textsuperscript{3}Once his wounds had healed he summoned everyone who had provided him with funds and ordered the funds to be recorded as having been received (sc. by them as loans from him). Whenever he seemed to have imposed too small a burden on anyone, he requisitioned more money. \textsuperscript{4}He instituted a levy of men of equestrian rank. His practice was invite these men, drafted from every community and colony and thoroughly cowed by (sc. the prospect of) military service overseas, to purchase an exemption from the military oath. This was a great source of revenue but neverthess began to create greater hatred. \textsuperscript{5}After finishing this business he purified the entire army. The legions and auxiliary troops that he was going to take to Africa he sent to the crossing point. \textsuperscript{6}He himself went to Seville to inspect the fleet that he was preparing. He lingered there because he had put forth an edict throughout his province ordering into his presence those from whom he had requisitioned funds and who had not yet made their contributions. This summons disturbed everyone greatly. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{57} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile, Lucius Titius, who at the time was serving as military tribune in the indigenous legion, reported that it had parted company with the 30th legion (which the legate Quintus Cassius was leading simultaneously) when he was encamped at the town Leptis—a mutiny had occurred and some centurions (who were not permitting the removal of the standards) had been killed—and marched in the direction of the second legion. This was being led to the strait by another route. \textsuperscript{2}Upon learning of this, he (sc. Cassius Longinus) left by night with 5 cohorts of men from the 21st legion, and early in the morning he arrived at †noctu† (or (sc. at Leptis?)). Having delayed there for one day, to get a clear view of what was happening, he marched to Carmo. \textsuperscript{3}When the 30th legion, the 21st legion, 4 cohorts from the 5th legion, and all the cavalry had assembled there, he heard that 4 cohorts (sc. of the 5th legion), overpowered by soldiers of the indigenous legion near Obucula, had reached the second (sc. legion) along with them, and that they had all joined forces there and chosen †in† Torius from Italica as leader. \textsuperscript{4}Having quickly held a council, he (sc. Cassius) sent his quaestor Marcellus to Corduba so as to secure that town in his possession, and he sent his legate Quintus Cassius to Seville. \textsuperscript{5}After a few days news was brought to him that the Corduban assembly had defected from him, and that Marcellus, motivated either by his own volition or by necessity (for reports about this vary), was acting in accord with the Cordubans, and that 2 cohorts from the 5th legion (which had been in the garrison at Corduba) were doing the same. \textsuperscript{6}Enraged by these developments, Cassius packed up camp and came to Segovia on the Singiliensen river the next day. Holding an assembly, he tested the morale of the soldiers. He discovered that these were extremely loyal to him not for his own sake but for the absent Caesar's, and that they would refuse no danger provided that the province was restored to Caesar through their agency.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{58} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile, Torius led the veteran legions to Corduba. And lest it appear that the beginning of dissension had arisen in a mutinous disposition that he or his soldiers possessed, and at the same time to counter Quintus Cassius (who in Caesar's name seemed to have more substantial resources at his disposal) with an equally powerful authority, he kept saying openly that he wanted to recover the province for Pompey. \textsuperscript{2}Perhaps he did this, too, from hatred for Caesar and love of Pompey, whose name carried much power among those legions that had been under the control of M. Varro. His intentions in (sc. doing) it were a matter of widespread conjecture. But this is certainly the pretext he used. \textsuperscript{3}The soldiers' declarations were so explicit that they had the name of Gnaeus Pompey engraved on their shields. \textsuperscript{4}The citizen community in large numbers—not only of men but also of matrons and youths in citizen dress—came out to meet the legions and pleaded with them not to plunder Corduba with a hostile attack: for they agreed with everyone against Cassius, they said, and begged that they not be compelled to act against Caesar.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{59} \textsuperscript{1}The army, moved by the entreaties and tears of such a great multitude, when it saw that the name and memory of Gnaeus Pompey was not necessary for taking punitive action against Cassius, and that Longinus was hated as much by all Caesarians as by all Pompeians, and that they themselves were unable to lead the citizen community or Marcus Marcellus against Caesar’s cause, removed the name of Pompey from their shields, accepted Marcellus, who began declaring himself a defender of Caesar’s cause, as their leader, named him praetor, joined themselves to the citizen community, and established their camp at Corduba. \textsuperscript{2}Cassius made his camp two days later about four miles from Corduba on the other side of the river Baetis in a high place within sight of the town. He sent letters to King Bogud in Mauretania and to Marcus Lepidus, the proconsul in nearer Spain, that he should come with assistance for him and the province as soon as possible, for the cause of Caesar. He himself, in a hostile manner, devastated the fields of Corduba and burned the buildings.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{60} \textsuperscript{1}Because of the heinous and base character of this action, the legions that had taken Marcellus as their leader ran to him: they should be led out into battle, and there should be a chance for them to fight before, so humiliatingly, the finest and most beloved possessions of the Cordubans were consumed in their own sight by plunder, sword, and fire. \textsuperscript{2}Marcellus, although he thought that combat was utterly wretched, because the loss for both the victor and the defeated would similarly redound on Caesar, and it was not within his official capacity, led his legions across the Baetis and drew up his battle line. \textsuperscript{3}When he noticed that Cassius had drawn up his line opposite, in front of his own camp and on higher ground, having given the explanation that he \surplus{Cassius} was not descending onto level ground, Marcellus persuaded his soldiers to withdraw into the camp. Thus he began to bring back his troops. \textsuperscript{4}Cassius, having attacked the retreating legions with cavalry, in which resource he was strong and knew Marcellus was weak, killed many of those in the rear on the river banks. \textsuperscript{5}Since it had become known from this loss what problem and difficulty the river crossing posed, Marcellus moved his camp across the Baetis. And both men frequently led out their legions into the battle line, but they did not fight because of the difficulties of the location.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{61} \textsuperscript{1}Marcellus was much stronger in infantry forces. For he had veteran legions, experienced in many battles. Cassius was more confident of the loyalty than of the valor of his legions. \textsuperscript{2}Thus, when camp had been moved near camp and Marcellus had occupied a suitable place for a stronghold from which to be able to keep Cassius' forces from water, Longinus, afraid lest he be enclosed by some kind of siege in regions that were unfamiliar and unfriendly to him, set out from camp in silence at night and made for Ulia with a swift journey, because he believed the town was faithful to him. \textsuperscript{3}There he placed his camp so closely conjoined to the walls that he was protected on all sides from an attack by both the nature of the site (for Ulia is placed on a high mountain) and the city's very fortification. \textsuperscript{4}Marcellus followed him, and moved his camp near to Cassius’ camp, as close to Ulia as possible. And when the nature of the place was known to him, he was led by necessity to the point to which he very much wanted to bring matters, namely, not to fight (for if there was a possibility of conflict, he was not going to be able to resist his eager troops) and not to allow Cassius to wander too far, lest more peoples suffer those things that the Cordubans had suffered. \textsuperscript{5}With his strongholds placed in suitable locations and his earthworks making a continuous circuit of the town, he closed in Ulia and Cassius with fortifications. \textsuperscript{6}But before these could be finished Longinus sent out his entire cavalry. He believed that this would be useful to him if it did not allow Marcellus to forage and collect provisions, but that it would be a great disadvantage if, shut in by the siege and useless, it consumed necessary provisions. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{62} \textsuperscript{1}In a few days King Bogus, having received Quintus Cassius' letter, came with his forces, and he joined to the legion which he had brought with him several auxiliary cohorts of Spanish men. \textsuperscript{2}For as is customary to happen in civil conflicts, at that time in Spain several communities were supporting the affairs of Cassius, more were favorable toward Marcellus. \textsuperscript{3}Bogus approached with his forces to Marcellus’ outer fortifications. There was fierce fighting on both sides, and this happened frequently, with Fortune frequently shifting victory to each side; nevertheless, Marcellus was never driven away from his earthworks.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{63} \textsuperscript{1}Meanwhile, Lepidus came to Ulia from the nearer province with thirty-five legionary cohorts and a great number of cavalry and his remaining auxiliary troops, with the intention of resolving without any prejudice the conflicts of Cassius and Marcellus.  \textsuperscript{2}Marcellus entrusted and offered himself without any hesitation to this man when he came. Cassius, however, remained within his defenses, either because he thought that he was due more authority than Marcellus or because he was concerned lest Lepidus’ mind had been won over beforehand by his adversary's compliance.  \textsuperscript{3}Lepidus made camp at Ulia and shared everything with Marcellus. He ordered that there be no fighting. He invited Cassius to come out and gave his word for everything. \textsuperscript{4}When Cassius had hesitated for a long time as to what he should do and how much trust he should place in Lepidus, and discovered no outcome for his plan if he persisted in his opinion, he demanded that the fortifications be broken up and that a free exit be given to him. \textsuperscript{5}With not only a truce arranged but when they (sc. Lepidus and Marcellus) were leveling their now nearly constructed earthworks and the fortifications’ guards had been removed, the king's auxiliary troops made an attack against the stronghold of Marcellus that was closest to the king's camp—when no one was expecting it, if in fact that ‘no one’ included Cassius, for there was doubt concerning his complicity—and overpowered many soldiers there.  \textsuperscript{6}And had the battle not been quickly broken up by the righteous anger and help of Lepidus, a greater disaster would have been sustained.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{64} \textsuperscript{1}When a way had been made open for Cassius, Marcellus joined his camp to Lepidus. Lepidus and Marcellus (sc. set out) simultaneously for Corduba, Cassius set out with his forces for Carmo. \textsuperscript{2}Around the same time Trebonius the proconsul came to take control of the province. When Cassius learned about his arrival he placed the legions that he had had with him, as well as the cavalry, into their winter quarters. After quickly gathering all of his possessions he hastened to Malaca and embarked there even though the season was unfavorable for sailing, so that he might not have to entrust himself to Lepidus, Trebonius, and Marcellus, as he himself declared, so that he might not make a journey with lesser dignity through that province of which a great part had abandoned him, as his friends kept saying, and so that the cash collected from boundless pillaging might not come into anyone’s power, as others thought. \textsuperscript{3}When he, having made progress in weather that was favorable for winter, had put into the Ebro river to avoid the night, setting out thence, despite the storm growing a little more violent, believing that he would sail no more dangerously than before, with the incoming waves blocking the river mouth he perished right in the narrow outlet after his ship sank since he could neither maneuver his ship because of the river’s force nor keep it straight in such great waves.

\pstart
\textbf{65} \textsuperscript{1}When Caesar had come to Syria from Egypt and learned from those who had come to him from Rome (and found out from letters from the city) that many things at Rome were being administrated badly and inefficiently, and that no part of the Republic was being run well enough, because, so they said, both pernicious seditions were arising from in-fighting among (sc. plebeian) tribunes and, owing to favor-seeking and carelessness on the part of the military tribunes and (sc. of those) who were in charge of the legions, many things were being done contrary to military custom and practice, things that tended to relax discipline and severity, and when Caesar saw that all these things demanded his presence, he still thought it preferable to leave those provinces and regions into which he had come composed in such a way that they would be free from internal dissension, accept rights and laws, and dispense with their fear of foreign enemies. \textsuperscript{2}He hoped to fix these things quickly in Syria, Cilicia, and Asia because these provinces were not being threatened with war. In Bithynia and Pontus he saw that a greater burden hung over him. \textsuperscript{3}For he heard that Pharnaces had not left Pontus, and he didn’t think he would, since he had become very arrogant from the favorable battle that he had fought against Domitius Calvinus. \textsuperscript{4}Spending time in almost every city of significant importance (sc. in Syria), Caesar allocated rewards, both man by man and publicly, to those who deserved well of him, held hearings about and settled long-standing legal questions, (sc. and) after receiving into his trust kings, tyrants, and rulers neighboring the province—who had all flocked to him—on the condition that they guard and defend the province, sent them away as very good friends to both himself and the Roman people. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{66} \textsuperscript{1}After spending a few days in that province, he left his friend and kinsman Sextus Caesar in charge of the legions and Syria. He himself set out to Cilicia in the same fleet in which he had come. \textsuperscript{2}He called all the cities of this province to Tarsus, which was practically the noblest and strongest town in all Cilicia. \textsuperscript{3}When all the affairs of the province and the neighboring cities were settled there, owing to his desire to set out to make war he delayed no longer, and stopping at Mazaca for two days after forced marches through Cappadocia, Comana \gap{} the shrine of Bellona, the oldest and holiest in Cappadocia, which is worshipped with such great fervor that the priest of this goddess is considered second to the king by the consent of that people in majesty, command, and power. \textsuperscript{4}He awarded it to the very noble Lycomedes, a Bithynian who was born in the royal family of the Cappadocians and was seeking that priesthood again, his right (sc. to it) being not at all in doubt but nevertheless long discontinued on account of the adverse circumstances of his ancestors and a change in the royal line. \textsuperscript{5}Caesar handed over to Ariarathes, the brother of Ariobarzanes, because both of them deserved well of the Republic, so that the inheritance of the kingdom might not tempt Ariarathes, and so that an heir to the kingdom might not threaten \gap{} to Ariobarzanes to be under his power and command. Caesar began to complete with similar haste the journey he had begun.

\pstart
\textbf{67} \textsuperscript{1}When he (sc. Caesar) had arrived near Pontus and the territory of Gallograecia, Deiotarus, tetrarch of almost all of Gallograecia at that time—a title that the other tetrarchs kept asserting was granted neither by laws nor by custom, yet a man without doubt named king of Lesser Armenia by the senate—with his royal emblems put aside, and not only in ordinary clothing but even in the garb of the accused, came as a suppliant to Caesar in order to beseech (sc. Caesar) to forgive him the fact that, as he was located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons and was under the compulsion of armies and orders, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey. \textsuperscript{2}For (sc. he said that) his obligation was not to be a judge of the disputes of the Roman people but to obey orders on the spot. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{68} \textsuperscript{1}In reply to him, Caesar, after he had recalled his own very numerous services, which he as consul bestowed upon him by public decrees, and after he had argued that his (sc. Deiotarus') defense could not contain any excuse of ignorance on his part, since a man of such great foresight and attentiveness was able to know who held the city and Italy, where the senate and Roman people were, where the state was, plus who was consul after Lucius Lentulus and Gaius Marcellus, nevertheless he said that he was pardoned this deed because of his own earlier services, his long-standing hospitality and friendship, the man's status and age, and the requests of those numerous hosts and friends who had assembled to beg for mercy towards Deiotarus; (sc. he said) that he would examine the disputes of the tetrarchs later. He restored the royal clothing to him. \textsuperscript{2}As for the legion drawn from the stock of his fellow citizens that Deiotarus had built up with our nature and training, he ordered (sc. him) to bring it and his entire cavalry along to wage war.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{69} \textsuperscript{1}When he had come to Pontus and had collected into on place all of his forces, which were middling in number and experience in war—for, with the sixth legion excepted, which he had brought with him from Alexandria, a veteran (sc. legion) formerly engaged in many hardships and dangers and smaller by a large number of soldiers, partly from the difficulty of the marches and voyages and partly owing to the frequency of combat, to such a degree that there were fewer than a thousand men in it—there were three legions remaining, one belonging to Deiotarus, two that had been in the battle that we wrote Gnaeus Domitius had with Pharnaces. \textsuperscript{2}Envoys sent by Pharnaces approached Caesar and pleaded especially that his arrival not be hostile: for Pharnaces, (sc. they said), would do everything that had been ordered. \textsuperscript{3}And they pointed out most of all that Pharnaces had been willing to give no auxiliary forces to Pompey against Caesar, whereas Deiotarus, who had given (sc. auxiliary forces to Pompey), had nevertheless made amends to him (i.e., Caesar).
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{70} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar answered that he would be very fair to Pharnaces, if he (sc. Pharnaces) was going to do what he was promising. \textsuperscript{2}He did, however, warn the envoys in mild terms, as he was accustomed, that they should not criticize Deiotarus to him or boast excessively about this service, namely, that they had not sent auxiliary troops to Pompey. \textsuperscript{3}For (sc. he said) both that he did nothing more gladly than forgive suppliants and that he was unable to pardon the public abuse of provinces for those who had been dutiful towards himself. \textsuperscript{4}And yet as for the very service they were pointing out, (sc. he said) that it had been more advantageous for Pharnaces, who had made provisions so as not to be defeated, than for himself, to whom the immortal gods had granted victory. \textsuperscript{5}And so (sc. he said) that he pardoned Pharnaces for the great and serious abuse of the Roman citizens who had been trading in Pontus, since he was not able to make them whole again. \textsuperscript{6}For (sc. he said) that he was not able to restore their lost life to the slaughtered nor their manhood to the castrated; and Roman citizens had indeed endured this punishment, more heavy-handed than death. \textsuperscript{7}But (sc. he said that) he (sc. Pharnaces) should leave Pontus immediately and return the staff of the publicani and restore to Roman allies and citizens the remaining things that were under his control. \textsuperscript{8}(Sc. Caesar said that) if he (sc. Pharnaces) had acted, he should at that point send to him (sc. Caesar) the tributes and gifts that commanders were accustomed to receive from friends after successes. For Pharnaces had sent him a golden crown. After returning these answers, he sent the envoys back.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{71} \textsuperscript{1}But Pharnaces, having promised everything generously since he was hoping that Caesar, hastening and en route, would even trust his promises more freely than the situation allowed, so that he (sc. Caesar) might set out sooner and more honorably for more important matters—for everybody knew that Caesar was being called back to the city for many reasons—began acting more slowly, demanding a later day for departure, interposing contractual agreements, in short, obstructing. \textsuperscript{2}Caesar, since he recognized the man’s craftiness, was compelled to do by necessity what, at other times, he had been accustomed to do by nature, namely, to do battle more quickly than anyone expected.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{72} \textsuperscript{1}Zela is a town that lies in Pontus, (sc. the town) itself suitably fortified given that it stands on open ground. For a hill, natural but like one made by hand, supports a wall at a rather elevated height on all sides. \textsuperscript{2}Many large hills separated by valleys surround this town. And the highest of these, a single hill that on account of Mithridates’ victory and Triarius’ misfortune and the defeat of our army ([sc. it is] practically connected to the town by relatively high ground and paths) has a great notoriety in those parts and is not much more than three miles away from Zela—\textsuperscript{3}  this location Pharnaces occupied with all of his troops after the old earthworks of the camp that was lucky for his father were repaired.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{73} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar, when he had placed camp five miles away from the enemy and saw that the valleys by which the royal camp was fortified would fortify his own camp by the same interval, at any rate if the enemy had not seized these locations previously—they were much closer to the royal camp—, ordered that material for a rampart be brought inside the defenses. \textsuperscript{2}After this was done quickly, with all the legions readied for action the next night at the fourth watch and the baggage left behind in camp, at dawn, with the enemy unaware, he (sc. Caesar) seized that very spot where Mithridates had fought a successful battle against Triarius. \textsuperscript{3}To this spot he then ordered the slaves to convey from the camp all the collected material, so that no soldier would leave the defensive work, since it was by a space of no more than a mile that an interceding valley divided the enemy’s camp from the preliminary defensive work of Caesar’s camp.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{74} \textsuperscript{1}Pharnaces, when he suddenly noticed this at dawn, drew up all of his troops in front of his camp. Given the locations' large intervening height differential (i.e., between the camps of Caesar and Pharnaces), Caesar thought that these troops were drawn up in accordance with a common military custom, either in order to slow down his fortification work, so that more men might be held at arms, or for the sake of showing royal confidence, lest Pharnaces seem to defend his location more by fortification than by hand. \textsuperscript{2}Thus Caesar was not deterred from having the remaining part of his army constructed the defensive work while the front line was drawn up in front of the trench. \textsuperscript{3}But Pharnaces—whether compelled by the good fortune of his location, or induced by omens and religious scruples, which we later heard that he had obeyed, or after discovering how few of our troops were at arms, since he had believed that the great multitude of slaves that was carrying the material for a rampart in the manner of everyday fortification work was a great multitude of soldiers, or even out of confidence in his veteran army, which his officers boasted had fought in 22 pitched battles and won each time, along with contempt for our army, which he knew had been beaten by himself when Domitius was commander—after the decision to fight was entered into, began to descend via the precipitous valley. \textsuperscript{4}For some time Caesar kept laughing at the empty show and the massing of soldiers in a spot into which no sane enemy would advance, when in the meantime Pharnaces, with the same pace with which he had descended into the downward-sloping valley, began to climb the steep hill opposing him with his troops in battle formation. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{75} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar, shaken by Pharnaces’ unbelievable recklessness or confidence, caught unaware and unprepared, recalled his soldiers from the earthworks, ordered them to take up arms, brought forward his legions, and drew up his line. The sudden agitation produced by this state of affairs brought significant fear to our men. \textsuperscript{2}When the lines were not yet drawn up the king’s chariots, armed with scythes, dismayed the disorganized soldiers. But the chariots were quickly overwhelmed by a large number of missiles. \textsuperscript{3}The enemy line followed the chariots. And after raising a shout the forces clashed, with the nature of the place providing much help to Caesar’s forces, but the most help was provided by the benevolence of the immortal gods, who are present in all happenings of war, particularly those in which nothing was able to be effected by reason.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{76} \textsuperscript{1}After a great and bitter battle fought at close quarters, the beginning of victory appeared on the right flank, where the veteran sixth legion had been placed. As the enemy forces were being forced away downhill on that side, on the left flank and in the middle of the line, much more slowly but nevertheless with the same gods assisting, all the king’s troops were overwhelmed. \textsuperscript{2}And having been driven from their position as quickly as they had come up the slope easily, they were under pressure from the disadvantage of the terrain. And so after many of the soldiers had been killed, many others overwhelmed by their comrades falling, those who managed to flee using their speed—but still, having thrown away their weapons—being unarmed, were unable to accomplish anything from higher ground once they had crossed the valley. But our men, carried away by their victory, did not hesitate to move onto unfavorable ground and assault the fortifications. \textsuperscript{3}With the troops that Pharnaces left as a guard attempting to defend the camp, our men quickly gained possession of the enemy camp. As the entire multitude of his men had been killed or captured, Pharnaces fled with a few of his cavalry. \textsuperscript{4}If our assault on his camp had not granted him the opportunity to flee more freely, he would have been brought alive into Caesar’s power. 
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{77} \textsuperscript{1}Caesar, so many times a conqueror, was in a state of incredible happiness at such a victory, since he had brought about the end of a very great war with such speed, and he was happier still upon reflecting on the sudden danger, because an easy victory had been arisen out of difficult circumstances. \textsuperscript{2}On the day after he had retaken Pontus and distributed all of the royal spoils among the soldiers Caesar set out with unencumbered cavalry. He ordered the sixth legion to leave for Italy to receive prizes and honors, sent Deiotarus’ auxiliary forces back home, (sc. and) left two legions in Pontus with Caelius Vinicianus.
\pend

\pstart
\textbf{78} \textsuperscript{1}Thus he made his way through Gallograecia and Bithynia into Asia and investigated the disputes in all of these provinces and made judgements upon them; he allocated jurisdictions to the tetrarchs, kings, and states. \textsuperscript{2}As for Mithridates of Pergamum, by whom the situation in Egypt, which I have written about above, was brought to completion auspiciously and quickly, since he was born from a royal bloodline and even educated royally (for Mithridates, king of all Asia, had carried the child off from Pergamum into the camps with him, and kept him there for many years), Caesar made him king of Bosphorus, which had been under Pharnaces’ control, and, by placing a most friendly king between them, defended the Roman provinces from barbarian and hostile kings. \textsuperscript{3}He also granted Mithridates the tetrarchy over the people of Gallograecia (which had been occupied and held in Deiotarus' possession a few years earlier) by the right of his people and bloodline. \textsuperscript{5}Nevertheless, he did not delay anywhere longer than the exigency of the sedition in the cities seemed to permit. When these matters were handled most happily and efficiently, he came to Italy more quickly than everyone's expectation.

\noindent This sentence describes the last and most impressive of the defensive measures adopted by the Alexandrians against the newly arrived Caesar, namely, the construction of moveable siege towers. \textit{Obiectis} is the principal problem in this passage: its authenticity has long been questioned, with \cite{Scaliger} excising it and other critics offering emendations. \textit{Confixerant}, too, has been suspected.\par
1) As transmitted, the verb used to report the towers’ construction is \textit{confixerant}, “had cobbled together.” At its one other occurrence in the corpus in the context of construction the presence of an instrumental ablative shows the verb to be used more literally: {\itshape BG} 3.13.4 \textit{transtra ex pedalibus in altitudinem trabibus confixa} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{erant}) \textit{clauis ferris}.\footnote{Similar usages are attested in other authors ({\itshape TLL} 4.211.67–79 ‘figendo instruere’). Elsewhere in the corpus \textit{configere} appears in the context of combat: {\itshape BAlex} 40.2 \textit{legio … confixa et oppressa est}; {\itshape BAfr} 59.5 \textit{exercitum … iaculis configeret.}} Construction-related passages lacking the ablative can be found in, e.g., Vitruvius (10.6.3 \textit{tigna conlocantur in capitibus utraque parte habentia transuersaria confixa}; cf. 10.9.6, 10.15.7; see further {\itshape TLL} 4.211.79–212.3 ‘figendo coniungere’). But nowhere is the reference of the prepositional prefix as vague as it is in our passage: what is being fastened to what? Accordingly, substitutes have been supplied, \textit{confecerant} in the manuscript tradition itself, perhaps based on a later construction passage (13.4 \textit{paucis diebus contra omnium opinionem} \textit{quadriremes XXII, quinqueremes V confecerunt}), \textit{confinxerant} by Dauisius, appealing to Pliny for support ({\itshape Nat}. 10.93 \textit{eadem materia confingunt nidas} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{hirundines}]). The latter verb, however, does not seem to be used for human construction projects ({\itshape TLL} 4.214.60–73), and the former, although apparently apt, does not impose itself: in chapter 13 the prefix denotes completion rather than assembly. A better repair might be \textit{contexerant}, which Caesar uses in describing the protective coverings supplied for his mobile siege “tortoise” both with an instrumental ablative ({\itshape BC} 2.10.6 \textit{coria … centonibus conteguntur}) and absolutely ({\itshape BC} 2.10.5 \textit{musculus ut ab igni … tutus esset contegitur}).\footnote{He also uses it in connection with boats that are supplied either with decks ({\itshape BC} 2.4.2) or with camouflage ({\itshape BC} 3.24.1).}\par
2) \textit{Obiectis}, which occurs later in the description of these moveable military towers, makes little sense in context: if pack animals are pulling the towers, it is hard to see the relevance of their having been “placed opposite,” “in front of,” or “in the way of” the towers. The parallelism between \textit{funibus} and \textit{iumentis} is also peculiar.\par
\cite{Scaliger} addressed both problems by excising \textit{obiectis}, removing the reference to the animals’ position and construing \textit{funibus iumentisque} as instrumental ablatives with \textit{mouebant}. With this repair one can perhaps see \textit{obiectis} as a garbled reprise of \textit{subiectis} or a garbled anticipation of \textit{derectis}. However, in the Caesarian corpus there is no other instance of an instrumental ablative with \textit{moueo}: nobody ever moves an object by means of something else.\footnote{The verb \textit{moueo} in Caesar is most often used in the idiom \textit{mouere castra} ({\itshape BG} 1.39.7, 2.2.6, etc.) or in similar phrases involving the movement of troops or the changing of location ({\itshape BG} 3.15.3, etc.). Often \textit{moueo} is used in the passive voice, when someone is figuratively moved by something {\itshape (BG} 7.76.2, {\itshape BC} 1.4.2, etc.).} This is a usage with few parallels in Latin more generally (see {\itshape TLL} 8.1540.47–60). In the passive \textit{moueo} can be used with an ablative of manner (cf. Cic. {\itshape Phil.} 9.14, something moved \textit{nulla ui}) or absolutely, as when towers are moved forward in sieges (cf. {\itshape BG} 2.31.1, Curt. 4.6.9). The best parallel for an active \textit{moueo} with an object and an instrumental ablative — also a rope, as it turns out — comes from Propertius (4.11.51 \textit{tu, quae tardam mouisti fune Cybeben}). Because of the absence of relevant parallels for this usage, it seems prudent to proceed with the assumption that a participle is needed where the text reads \textit{obiectis} in order to form a second ablative absolute with \textit{funibus iumentisque}.\footnote{There is a comparable asyndetic pair of absolutes in a similar string of different sorts of ablatives at {\itshape BAlex} 11.6, which is also, incidentally, a passage about towing: \textit{Hac calamitate perterritis hostibus aduerso uento leniter flante naues onerarias Caesar remulco uictricibus suis nauibus Alexandriam deducit}. The expression \textit{naues remulco uictricibus suis nauibus deducit} is a decent structural parallel for \cite{Scaliger}’s hypothesized \textit{eas … funibus iumentisque … mouebant}, but both \textit{remulco} and \textit{nauibus} work reasonably well with \textit{deducit} (cf. {\itshape BC} 3.40.1), whereas neither of our ablatives works well with \textit{mouebant}. For other long strings of ablatives see 27.5 and 32.3.}\par
\cite{Castiglioni} emended \textit{obiectis} to \textit{adiectis}, assuming a palaeographically plausible innovation. This gives the sense of “fastened upon” or “added to.” Forms of \textit{adicere} occur ten times in the corpus, but it usually means to add on or adjoin something abstract or to describe geographical space (cf., e.g., 28.3 \textit{unum latus} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{castrorum}] \textit{erat adiectum flumini Nilo}). Here it would imply that the animals are added on to a larger contraption, which does not yield perfect sense.\par
\cite{Klotz} proposed \textit{obtectis} to describe the animals, which would be “covered” or “protected.” Caesar uses \textit{obtectus} to refer to military protection, which would suggest that the pack animals are shielded from opposing attack (cf. {\itshape BC} 3.19.7 \textit{quae [{\itshape sc}. tela] ille obtectus armis militum uitauit} and 3.54.1 \textit{uineis eam partem castrorum obtexit}). The context of our sentence does not necessitate this idea, and the necessity of taking \textit{iumentis} in tandem with \textit{funibus} makes it unlikely.\par
Contexts involving pack animals towing something frequently contain the verb \textit{iungere}. There are two potential problems with an emendation based on \textit{iungere}, however. First, \textit{iunctis} is paleographically further removed from \textit{obiectis} than either \textit{adiectis} or \textit{obtectis}. Second, \textit{iungere} usually refers to joining animals to one another rather than to other objects. However, the verb does occur with the etymologically related \textit{iumentum} (Nepos {\itshape Timol.} 4.2, Varro {\itshape RR} 1.52.1; cf. Var. {\itshape LL} 5.136) and in one passage of Vitruvius a yoked team of oxen pull a rope (Vitr. 10.2.14 \textit{bubus iunctis funem ducebant [{\itshape sc}. boues]}). So \textit{iunctis} is worth consideration here, even if \textit{funibus} is a loose end.\par
Compounds of \textit{iunctis} are also worth considering. \cite{Cornelissen} suggested \textit{subiunctis}, making the ropes and pack animals “subjoined” to the towers. He cites as parallels a line from Columella in which bullocks are attached to a plow (Col. 6.2.8 \textit{uacuo plostro subiungendi}) and a line from Virgil in which tigers are joined to a chariot (Virg. {\itshape Ecl.} 5.29 \textit{curru subiungere tigres}). Neither passage offers a parallel for \textit{funibus}, which sits oddly with the prefix \textit{sub}-, and the verb itself appears nowhere else in the corpus. The form \textit{adiunctis}, from a verb used eight times in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} and twenty-five times in the corpus overall, is perhaps a better repair. Aulus Gellius uses \textit{adiunctis} absolutely with \textit{iumenta} (Gel. 20.1.28 \textit{uectaculum … quod adiunctis pecoribus trahebatur}), and Horace uses it jokingly to describe yoking mice to a cart (Hor. {\itshape Sat}. 2.3.247 \textit{plostello adiungere mures}). However, nowhere in the corpus does \textit{adiungere} describe affixing something to an object.\par
It therefore seems best to leave \textit{obiectis} in its imperfection with the understanding that the syntax and general sense are clear, even if the original verb is not.

\noindent In the passage quoted above the string \textit{ut … absumeretur} is excised by \cite{Gruterus} (along with the following sentence), emended by many, and daggered by \cite{Andrieu}. The general problem is the loose logical connection between the Alexandrians’ apparent loyalty to the Romans (\textit{uidebatur}) and the idea that they require a defense from the author (\textit{ut mihi defendendi essent}). What we want to be told instead, as \cite{Madvig} observed (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=293}{281}), is why the Roman fears expressed in 7.1 (\textit{alii … extimescerent … quod neque celari Alexandrini possent in apparanda fuga, … neque illis imminentibus atque insequentibus ullus in naues receptus daretur}) were justified. A further problem is that the hypothetical defense is contradicted by later critiques centered on Alexandrian deceptiveness (24.1 \textit{Caesar etsi fallacem gentem semperque alia cogitantem, alia simulantem bene cognitam habebat}, 24.3 \textit{regius animus disciplinis fallacissimis eruditus, ne a gentis suae moribus degeneraret}; cf. also 24.6 \textit{fallaciis pueri}).\par
Editors who accept the basic authenticity of the transmitted text have to contend with a series of problems within the string itself, the most significant of which lie in the connectives. As transmitted the relevant part of the passage reads as follows:

\begin{quote}… desciuisse a suis uidebatur ut mihi defendendi essent Alexandrini \uline{neque} fallaces essent \uline{neque} temerarii multa\uline{que} oratio frustra absumeretur.\end{quote}

\noindent The connectives string together three dissimilar propositions: the opening reference to the necessity of a defense stands in parallel to \textit{neque fallaces essent neque temerarii}, which looks like part of the hypothetical defense and therefore seems to warrant subordination, and also to a declaration that defense would be a waste of breath, where the apparently adversative sense needs more than a linking \textit{-que}. The following sentence compounds the problem by abandoning the idea of defense and instead indicting the Alexandrians for their aptitude for treachery. (Here, however, we do get a nice robust \textit{uero}.)\par
Smaller problems include the singular pronoun \textit{mihi}, which clashes with the normally plural forms used for self reference by the author, and the word \textit{absumo}, which is used nowhere else in the corpus and generally avoided by Incertus’ contemporaries. The punctuation is another variable: the string \textit{ut … absumeretur} is sometimes printed as a stand-alone sentence and sometimes integrated with what precedes. The passage also suffers from guilt by association, so to speak, in that criticism of the Alexandrians is associated with textual problems elsewhere in the work.\footnote{See, e.g., 27.5 [\textit{uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia}], {\itshape BC} 3.112.12 [\textit{nutricius pueri et procurator regni, in parte Caesaris}], and the excision suggested at 24.2 (\textit{adulta iam aetate puerum}). Of relevance also, perhaps, is the peculiar repeated omission of the subject \textit{Alexandrini} (16.7, 17.4, 17.6). But none of these has anything like the complicated structure of the present passage.}\par
\cite{Gruterus} excision is a drastic response to this assemblage of problems of sense and usage. They look less unacceptable if considered one by one.\par
1) \textit{Mihi} is indeed a striking move by Incertus, who momentarily turns the reader’s attention to himself.\footnote{Thus \cite{Madvig} (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=293}{281}): “mire scriptor suam personam interponit.”} As was mentioned above, for authorial comments he, like Caesar, usually employs the plural (28.2 \textit{demonstrauimus}, 33.2 \textit{docuimus}, 69.1 and 78.2 \textit{scripsimus}, 74.3 \textit{audiebamus}). However, there are exceptions to this, in Incertus as in Caesar (30.5 \textit{demonstraui}, 35.3 \textit{scripsi}). Such passages are generally cross references, but he occasionally speaks as a historian at work (23.1 \textit{ut coniectura possumus}: cf. also \textit{nobis} at 3.1 and 19.6, with textual notes ad locc.). Since the unusual \textit{mihi} here is paralleled by an equally unusual \textit{mihi} in a similar sort of ethnographic reflection at {\itshape BG} 6.14.4 (\textit{id mihi duabus de causis instituisse uidentur} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{Galli}]), it does not in itself warrant suspicion about the authenticity of the passage.\par
2) \textit{Absumeretur} is the only word in the passage that is alien to the Caesarian corpus and indeed to its time period. One might have expected \textit{consumeretur}, from a synonymous verb that occurs more than 40 times in the corpus (cf. {\itshape BC} 1.33.4 \textit{frustra diebus aliquot consumptis}). But the presence of the ‘wrong’ prefix is a very slender cause for suspicion, since altering the prefix is a frequent form of innovation in this tradition and the often abbreviated \textit{con}- is particularly susceptible.\footnote{See \cite{Damon2015a}, 172–74.}\par
3) The logical problems mentioned above have elicited numerous repairs. Many editors will have felt, with Madvig, a reluctance to excise something whose origin they cannot explain.\footnote{Thus \cite{Madvig} (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=293}{281}): “eiicere ea non audeo, quod neque, quemadmodum addere in mentem cuiquam venerit, intelligere possum, nec huiusmodi annotationum aliud vestigium in Caesaris codicibus reperio.”} In the \textit{editio princeps} the string \textit{ut … absumeretur} appears with four deviations from what we now know to be the paradosis, and two of these emendations were accepted by many subsequent editors, namely, the addition of \textit{quod} after \textit{Alexandrini} and the excision of -\textit{que}.

\begin{quote}… desciuisse a suis uidebatur ut \uline{tum} mihi defendendi essent Alexandrini \uline{quod} neque fallaces essent neque temerarii: \uline{multa} oratio frustra \uline{absumerent}.\end{quote}

\noindent The first of these innovations creates the subordination desiderated above, the second improves the logic somewhat but leaves \textit{multa … absumerent} rather isolated. Neither \textit{tum} nor \textit{absumerent} is essential to the repair and they were quickly dropped when better manuscript evidence became available, as in the edition of \cite{Vascosanus}, who also retained \textit{-que} and repunctuated:

\begin{quote}… desciuisse a suis uidebatur: ut mihi defendendi essent Alexandrini \uline{quod} neque fallaces essent, neque temerarii, multaque oratio frustra absumeretur.\end{quote}

\noindent With this repair \textit{multa … absumeretur} is now parallel to \textit{defendendi essent} in a clause whose loose syntactic connection to \textit{desciuisse a suis uidebatur} matches the above-mentioned looseness of thought. The \textit{ut}-clause has to be a result clause of sorts, but the antecedent cause is the unstated implication of \textit{uidebatur}: “they \uline{seemed} to have cut their ties with their own side (but people feared they had not).” And even with this inference the connection between cause and result is quite loose. Only when we get to following sentence, with its introductory \textit{cum uero}, do we see that the point of our passage is that it would be a waste of time to argue that the fears were misplaced, since the evidence for Alexandrian treacherousness is close to hand.\footnote{\cite{Vielhaber1869} suggested that the interpolation excised by \cite{Gruterus} displaced some original text, the sense of which is perhaps preserved in \textit{aptissimum … potest} (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=633}{555}).} As \cite{Madvig} says, Incertus uses “\textit{inutilibus verborum ambagibus}” here (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=293}{281}). The \textit{quod}-clause, too, is odd. There are no parallels in the Corpus for \textit{defendere quod}; one has to go to Livy for an equivalent (42.41.13 \textit{non sum defensurus … quod Dolopas armis coercuerim}). \cite{Aldus} substituted \textit{si} for \textit{ut}, addressing the loose connection by creating an independent conditional sentence, but this repair also requires accepting \textit{multa} for \textit{multaque}. The compound innovation is hard to explain in both Aldus’ version and Madvig’s improvement on it:

\begin{quote}… desciuisse a suis uidebatur: \uline{at} mihi, \supplied{si} defendendi essent Alexandrini …, multa\surplus{que} oratio frustra absumeretur.\footnote{The second ellipsis is present in Madvig’s article, so it is not clear whether or not he accepts Nipperdey’s \textit{esse}. Presumably so. See further \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} 2013, 68 n. 185.}\end{quote}

\noindent \cite{Nipperdey} addressed the \textit{quod}-clause problem by substituting \textit{esse} for \textit{essent}\textsuperscript{2}:

\begin{quote}… desciuisse a suis uidebatur: ut mihi defendendi essent Alexandrini neque fallaces \uline{esse} neque temerarii, multaque oratio frustra absumeretur.\footnote{\cite{Klotz} merges \cite{Aldus}’ conditional with \cite{Nipperdey}’s indirect statement: \textit{… desciuisse a suis uidebatur: ut mihi, \supplied{si} defendendi essent Alexandrini neque fallaces \uline{esse} neque temerarii, multa\surplus{que} oratio frustra absumeretur}. But the genesis of the three-fold innovation is hard to explain.}\end{quote}

\noindent The innovation is easy to explain as a “correction” designed to bring \textit{esse} into alignment with the nearby subjunctives \textit{essent} and \textit{absumeretur}. There are comparable snippets of loosely integrated indirect statement in the Corpus, often in connection with verbs denoting emotional intensity, as here with \textit{defendendi}.\footnote{Cf. {\itshape BG} 3.6.1 (\textit{cohortati}), 6.41.1 (\textit{questus}); {\itshape BC} 1.64.2 (\textit{dolere}), 2.4.3 (\textit{precibus et fletu}), 3.28.4 (\textit{iureiurando}), 3.31.4 (\textit{militum uoces}), 3.82.4 (\textit{implorarent}), and see Damon 2015b, 107 n.8. In the relevant {\itshape TLL} examples of \textit{defendere} with acc. + inf. ({\itshape TLL} 5.1.298.84–299.4) the equivalent for \textit{Alexandrini} in our passage is a reflexive pronoun (e.g., Liu. 32.40.1 \textit{ille ab ipsis Argiuis se defenderet accitum}). The nominative \textit{temerarii} in our passage indicates that the “snippet” is notionally dependent on a verb such as \textit{uiderentur}.} And Incertus gives us another rather loose result clause at 22.2: \textit{Nec diuulgata Caesaris hortatio subsequi legionum aut laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem, ut magis deterrendi et continendi a periculosissimis essent dimicationibus quam incitandi ad pugnandum}. Here the syntax is similar, if less complex.\par
On balance it seems best to accept this minimally emended text. The logic is murky and the language awkward indeed, but the very murkiness of the logic is, as \cite{Madvig} saw, an argument against \textit{ut … absumeretur} (let alone \textit{ut … potest}) being an interpolation.

\noindent The first sentence of this passage, as transmitted, has a number of glaring problems. The most substantial is the incompatibility of the main clause, which is about a loss of morale (\textit{adeo sunt fracti Alexandrini}), and the apparent result clause, which is about defensive capability (\textit{ut ex aedificiis defendi possent}). The antecedent of \textit{quibus} is another puzzle: does the relative pronoun refer to Roman \textit{classiarii}, Alexandrians, or something that can function in tandem with \textit{locis}? And then there is the difficulty of making sense of \textit{materiam cunctam} in light of the earlier assertion that Alexandrian buildings contained no \textit{materia} (1.3 \textit{\supplied{ab} incendio fere tuta est Alexandria, quod sine contignatione ac materia sunt aedificia et structuris ac fornicibus continentur tectaque sunt rudere aut pauimentis}). These problems are interconnected, which complicates the task of seeing and explaining solutions, but the context, especially the subsequent sentence (quoted above), provides something of a framework to use in approaching them.\par
The passage we are concerned with reports the beginning of the aftermath of an unexpected naval defeat suffered by the Alexandrians, who had hoped to catch Caesar in a moment of vulnerability (10.3 \textit{magnam sibi facultatem fortunam obtulisse bene gerendae rei crediderunt}) but barely avoided losing their entire fleet (11.5 \textit{Quod nisi nox proelium diremisset, tota classe hostium Caesar potitus esset}). In the sentence immediately before our passage they return to Alexandria terrified (11.6 \textit{perterritis}). The immediately following sentence, introduced with an emphatic \textit{idem}, shows the resilience of their military commander, Ganymedes (see 4.2), and the revival of hope and confidence in the Alexandrians themselves. Details follow in 12.3–13.4. This is the context into which our problematic sentence needs to fit.\par
It will be helpful to begin by reviewing the (relatively) secure ground in our sentence. As was mentioned above, it begins with the Alexandrian loss of morale (\textit{adeo sunt fracti Alexandrini}). It ends with a causal clause concerning their fears about a possible fleet-based attack on the city (\textit{quod nostrae classis oppugnationem etiam ad terram uerebantur}). \textit{Verebantur} might be a restatement of \textit{fracti}, but it might also show that the Alexandrians have overcome their panic and started taking sensible precautions. In the latter scenario, our sentence mirrors the turnaround reported in 12.2. In the former scenario, our sentence stands in contrast to 12.2. The emphatic \textit{idem} is compatible with either scenario (parallel: {\itshape BG} 6.13.5, {\itshape BAfr} 22.2, 28.2; contrasting: {\itshape BAlex} 18.3). According to the \textit{cum}-clause, the morale problem was particularly acute because the Alexandrians had been defeated in the arena where they felt most confident, the sea, and now needed to defend themselves on land, a situation that seems to underlie both \textit{aedificiis defendi possent} and \textit{materiam … obicerent}.\par
Early editors left the spot alone, presumably taking the antecedent for \textit{quibus} to be \textit{uirtus} and \textit{scientia} and \textit{quibus} itself as an instrumental ablative parallel to \textit{locis} (cf. {\itshape BG} 1.40.6 \textit{quos … usus ac disciplina … subleuarent}). The lack of \textit{materia} in Alexandria is perhaps made less worrisome by a later passage about roof beams (13.2 \textit{Porticus gymnasia publica aedificia detegebant, asseres remorum usum obtinebant}) that encourages taking 1.3 \textit{sine contignatione ac materia} as a hendiadys, “without wooden decking.” But the larger sense problem eventually attracted attention and a variety of approaches.\par
\cite{Manutius} proposed a simple solution to the aforementioned incompatibility, replacing \textit{ex} with the negation \textit{uix}: the Alexandrians are so dispirited by the naval disaster that they can \uline{scarcely} feel secure in the city itself. It is easy enough to supposed that \textit{uix} was misread as \textit{ex} before \textit{aedificiis}, and a similar scene plays out later on Pharos Island with an explicit reference to the situation in Alexandria: 18.1 \textit{Neque uero diutius ea munitione se continere potuerunt etsi erat non dissimile atque Alexandriae genus aedificiorum, ut minora maioribus conferantur, turresque editae et coniunctae muri locum obtinebant}.\par
But neither \cite{Manutius}’ repair, nor \cite{Dinter}'s subsequent suggestion that \textit{uix} fell out before \textit{ex}, sits at all well with \textit{cunctam}. And yet the two subjunctive expressions seem to be aligned in content as well as form.\par
\cite{Rhellicanus} took a completely different approach, supplying (or understanding) \textit{a} before \textit{quibus} and specifying that the antecedent is \textit{classiariorum}.\footnote{Rhellicanus’ note as quoted by \cite{Jungermann} is not clear on this point, but it does not seem possible to take \textit{quibus} (without \textit{a}) as a separation ablative in context; Cellarius’ paraphrase of Rhellicanus includes the preposition. \textit{Quibus} is construed as an instrumental ablative parallel to \textit{superioribus locis} by Glandorp, taking the antecedent to be \textit{classiarii sui}, but the Alexandrian sailors are never called \textit{classiarii}.} The idea is that the Alexandrians’ elevated positions provided them with assistance \uline{against} attackers coming from the Roman fleet. Incertus does use the preposition \textit{ab} in this sense (78.2 \textit{prouincias … \uline{a barbaris atque inimicis regibus} … muniuit}, cf. 61.3 \textit{ab oppugnatione tutus}), and similar usages can be found elsewhere in the corpus (cf. esp. Hirt. 8.9.4 \textit{ut \uline{ab hostibus} duplici fossa, duplici propugnatorum ordine defenderentur}), but nowhere with a verb like \textit{subleuabantur}, with which \textit{a quibus} would be much more likely to be construed as a personal agent (cf. {\itshape BG} 1.16.6 \textit{grauiter eos accusat quod … ab iis non subleuetur}). With this repair the point of \textit{et} is also hard to fathom.\par
\cite{Dauisius1706} postulated a lacuna in the text before \textit{quibus}. But therafter he rather throws up his hands, “cum de locis tam mutilis nihil certo possit definiri.” \cite{Nipperdey} placed the lacuna after \textit{quibus}, a position preferred by subsequent editors since it allows one to avoid specifying the identity of the antecedent: it could be the Romans or the Alexandrians, or for that matter \textit{uirtus} and \textit{scientia}. Both lacunas leave a space in which the meaning of \textit{materia cuncta} might have been made clear. But we will argue below that the expression \textit{locis subleuabantur} is problematic.\par
First, however, another approach. \cite{Dinter} rewrote the passage:

\begin{quote}adeo sunt fracti Alexandrini … ut uix ex aedificiis defendi posse se confiderent, quibus et superioribus locis subleuabantur, et materiam cunctam obicerent, quod nostrae classis oppugnationem etiam ad terram uerebantur.\end{quote}


\begin{quote}The Alexandrians were so shattered … that they scarcely trusted that it was possible for themselves to be defended from the buildings, from which, as well as from their higher positions, they used to derive support, and interposed all the wood as a barrier, because they feared an attack by our fleet even on land.\end{quote}

\noindent The core of this repair is a transposition, but it also involves adding \textit{uix} before \textit{ex} (as was mentioned above) and emending \textit{possent} to \textit{posse se confiderent}.\footnote{Many will share \cite{Larsen}’s reaction (1886, 6): “hac tanta licentia locum sanari non posse, omnes statim intellegent.” Further changes are proposed by \xref{Fleischer}{Fleischer} 1879, 860.} It also requires that the negation be taken with only the first of two parallel verbs, with \textit{confiderent} but not \textit{obicerent}. In other words, the syntax is difficult, the necessary sequence of innovations is implausibly complicated, and the mystery of \textit{materia cuncta} is revived.\par
\cite{Kübler1896b} shed welcome light on the problem of \textit{locis} by suggesting that it be emended to \textit{temporibus}, presumably by analogy with {\itshape BG} 7.14.3 \textit{quod anni tempore subleuentur}. He printed \textit{locis} here but \textit{temporibus} at a later problem spot also involving \textit{locis}.\footnote{At 72.2 Kübler prints \textit{detrimentum … superioribus \supplied{acceptum} temporibus} for the transmitted \textit{detrimentum … superioribus locis atque itineribus}. For discussion see his note in {\itshape Philologus} 55 (1896) \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015029918151?urlappend=\%3Bseq=214}{154–55}.} The argument for \textit{temporibus} here is admittedly weaker since he also accepted \cite{Nipperdey}’s lacuna, which makes it hard to see what \textit{temporibus} might refer to. But \textit{locis} does deserve scrutiny.\par
One necessary step in wringing sense from the transmitted text is deciding whether \textit{subleuabatur} is to be taken literally (“raised up”) or metaphorically (“assisted”), and how \textit{locis} is to be construed with it. The verb is accompanied by simple ablatives in both its literal ({\itshape BG} 1.48.7 \textit{iubis equorum subleuati}) and metaphorical senses (e.g., \textit{re … frumentaria}, \textit{industria}, \textit{anni tempore}, \textit{opibus}). But there are no good parallels for \textit{locis} with either sense of \textit{subleuari}. The expression \textit{superioribus locis} might suggest that literal lifting is appropriate here but the imperfect tense is against it.\footnote{Unless the subject of \textit{subleuabantur} is something like \textit{asseres} (cf. 13.2) and the lost text shows that the imperfect has a sense other than “used to be.” This would clarify \textit{materiam cunctam} nicely.} The sense of being assisted or even supplied from a place is paralleled in the {\itshape Bellum Africum} (41.2 \textit{oppidum … unde aquari reliquisque rebus subleuari eius exercitus consuerat}; cf. {\itshape BAlex} 43.1 \textit{neque prouinciae facultatibus subleuabatur}), and the sense of mounting a defense from an elevated place in the {\itshape Bellum Hispaniense} (12.5 \textit{oppidani superiore loco defendebantur}, 31.1 \textit{aduersarii loco superiore se defendebant}) but the constructions are different.\footnote{The possibility of fighting against Caesar’s boats from Alexandria’s elevated locations and buildings was in fact mentioned earlier, in Caesar’s \textit{contio}: 8.5–6 \textit{Magnam autem moram et difficultatem ascensum in naues habere praesertim ex scaphis. Summam esse contra in Alexandrinis uelocitatem locorumque et aedificiorum notitiam. Hos … loca excelsiora atque aedificia occupaturos. Ita fuga nauibusque nostros prohibituros}. But this passage provides no help for the construction of our passage.} It therefore seems unlikely that the ablative is instrumental in our passage. As a local ablative \textit{locis superioribus} appears in the corpus both with and without the preposition \textit{in}. It might also be part of an ablative absolute (cf. {\itshape BG} 1.23.3 \textit{superioribus locis occupatis}, Hirt. 8.13.3 \textit{amissis superioribus locis}, 8.36.3 \textit{relictis locis superioribus}) or a separation ablative (e.g., {\itshape BG} 4.23.3 \textit{ut ex locis superioribus in litus telum adigi posset}; cf. {\itshape BAlex} 17.4 \textit{ex tectis aedificiorum propugnabant}). These three constructions either require or are compatible with a lacuna after \textit{et}.\par
This leaves us with a relative clause beginning \textit{quibus et}. It probably contained either a laudatory description of the Roman \textit{classiarii} (26.1 \textit{et uoluntate et … diligentia}, 26.2 \textit{et … magnitudine … et perseuerantia}, 31.1 \textit{et animi magnitudine et … scientia}, 41.1 \textit{et uictor et … rex}, 43.4 \textit{et fortuna … et uirtus}) or an assessment of the Alexandrians’ plight (15.4 \textit{et dedecori et dolori}, 43.4 \textit{et infelicitas … et … mors}). The \textit{et … et} construction, which Incertus uses liberally (18x), would fit either scenario. The rest of the material lost in the lacuna would perhaps describe how despite the defeat the Alexandrians began to contemplate a land-based defense as a preliminary to the revival of their naval hopes once Ganymedes promised assistance (12.2).\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} (1954, 12 n. 2) asserts that the missing text “avait sans doute quelque étendue,” perhaps describing the organization of the Eunostos harbor and the fortifications. For other reconstructions of what has been lost see \cite{Larsen} (1886, 6–7).} At a minimum we need an explanation of the mysterious \textit{materia cuncta}.

\noindent The text enumerates the naval forces that Caesar had under his command at the beginning of the battle in the Eunostos harbor of Alexandria in 47 BCE. The paradosis has been questioned on both philological and historical grounds.\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] The awkward language of the parenthesis introduced by \textit{nam} has drawn the most critical attention. \cite{Larsen}, feeling that the ablative absolute \textit{decem missis} is intolerably harsh, supplies \textit{de}, producing a well paralleled construction ({\itshape u. TLL} 5.1.58.74–59.28 ). But Incertus uses a similar expression at 15.5 \textit{progressis ultra uadum IIII}, so emendation does not seem necessary.\footnote{If that is how the opening of 15.5 should be construed. See the apparatus notes {\itshape ad loc}.} The string \textit{in} \textit{cursu litore Aegyptio} has likewise been queried. \cite{Nipperdey} asserted that \textit{in cursu} and \textit{litore} were contradictory — “cursus enim in littore Aegyptio erat confectus” (1847, 190) — and therefore excised \textit{litore} as a scribal gloss on the unusual expression \textit{in cursu Aegyptio}. It is indeed unusual: the common expression \textit{in cursu} never takes an adjectival toponym. Such adjectives are, however, used with \textit{litus} (cf., e.g., Cic. {\itshape Sest}. 140 \textit{in litore Dyrrachino}). Larsen proposed adding \textit{sub} before \textit{litore}, comparing {\itshape BG} 5.57.3 \textit{sub castris eius uagabatur}. That after \textit{cursu} the preposition \textit{sub} might be overlooked is obviously possible, but the absence of the expression \textit{sub litore} elsewhere weighs against this emendation. Furthermore, the paradosis is paralleled at {\itshape BG} 4.23.6 \textit{aperto ac plano litore naues constituit,} where the bare ablative has a locative function and, as it appears from the context, in which Caesar’s ships cannot land on the beaches, \textit{litore} does not signify the shore itself but the waters just offshore (for this sense of the word see {\itshape TLL s.u. litus} 7.2.1537.52–1538.10 “respicitur litoris pars uda, tam area undis et aestu affecta quam mare terrae uicinum”).\footnote{Are we perhaps to understand that the Rhodian ship ran aground upon the treacherous \textit{uada Aegyptia} mentioned at Luc. 8.539–40 ({\itshape perfida qua tellus Casiis excurrit harenis/ et uada testantur iunctas Aegyptia Syrtes})?} The peculiarity of \textit{deficere} for a ship “foundering” is highlighted by the fact that its nearest parallel is Verg. {\itshape Aen}. 6.354, where Palinurus tells Aeneas he fears less for himself than that \textit{tua …} / \textit{deficeret tantis nauis surgentibus undis}.\footnote{R. G. Austin, 1986, \textit{P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber Sextus}, Oxford, {\itshape ad loc.} cites 13.5 as a parallel for the Vergil passage.} An additional problem with \textit{defecerat} is that in a civil war context it could easily be construed as a reference to defection (see {\itshape TLL} 5.1.327.79–328.7), something perhaps better passed over in silence in an account such as ours. So different verbs have been proposed for the spot. Ciacconius’ suggestion of \textit{decesserat}, based on {\itshape BC} 3.112.3 \textit{naues … suo cursu decesserunt}, is rebutted by \cite{Dauisius1727} on the grounds that the senses required in the two passages are different (“deviate” in the latter, “perish” in the former); it is also harder to take \textit{litore} as a locative ablative with this verb. \xref{Siesbye}{Siesbye} proposed \textit{desederat}, from a verb used of sinking ships at Sen. {\itshape Nat}. 6.6.4 \textit{nauigia desidunt}. However, in defense of the paradosis one can cite {\itshape BC} 3.2.3 \textit{multi \surplus{galli} tot bellis defecerant}, “many men had succumbed ({\itshape or} defected) in the numerous wars,” which shares with our passage both the ablative and the possibility of misconstrual.
\item[2] There is also a problem of some historical consequence here. Scholars were content with the transmitted reading {\itshape l(i/y)(c/t)ias = Lycias} until \cite{Schneider} proposed the emendation \textit{Cilicias}, with the addition of some unknown number after \textit{Syrias}, citing 1.1 as evidence: \textit{Caesar Rhodo atque ex Syria Ciliciaque omnem classem arcessit}. Schneider’s conjecture has since been adopted by \cite{Kübler1896a}, \cite{Klotz}, and \cite{Andrieu}, among others.
\end{enumerate}\par
What is immediately clear, and should make us wary of accepting \cite{Schneider}’s conjecture too readily, is that, with or without the conjecture, the list at 1.1 does not correspond to that at 13.5: in the former, the sources for Caesar’s fleet are given as Rhodes, Syria, and Cilicia; in the latter, the ships are from Rhodes, Pontus, and Asia, along with whatever the lemma in question represents. Also relevant is Caesar’s report at {\itshape BC} 3.106.1: \textit{cum … nauibus longis Rhodiis X et Asiaticis paucis Alexandriam peruenit ({\itshape sc}. Caesar)}. If Caesar arrived in Alexandria with these ten Rhodian ships, then summoned more from Rhodes (1.1), at the time of the harbor battle he would have had more than the nine Rhodian ships reported in 13.5. \cite{Barwick} adduced this discrepancy as evidence against the analytical interpretation of the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}.\footnote{K. Barwick, 1938, {\itshape Caesars Commentarii und das Corpus Caesarianum}, Leipzig: 180 n. 1.} \cite{Rice-Holmes} suspected that Hirtius’ (\textit{sic}) text at 1.1 was simply “a mistake.”\footnote{T. Rice Holmes, 1923, {\itshape The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire Vol. 3}, Oxford: 484 n. 7.} But the parenthesis of the present sentence, an awkward addition, as we have seen, is perhaps to be understood as Incertus’ clarification of Caesar’s shorthand at {\itshape BC} 3.106.1.\par
\cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} have recently defended the paradosis with the argument that 1.1 refers to reinforcements that had been ordered but had not yet arrived at the time of the battle; \textit{decem missis} at 13.5 thus refers to the ten Rhodian ships said to have come with Caesar at {\itshape BC} 3.106.1.\footnote{J. F. Gaertner and B. Hausburg, 2013, {\itshape Caesar and the Bellum Alexandrinum}, Göttingen, 51–52, citing also P. Graindor, 1931, {\itshape La guerre d’Alexandrie}, Cairo: 29–30: 101, and Andrieu (1954, lviii–lix). Andrieu dismantles the argument in favor of the paradosis based on 14.1–2, where Caesar is said to have positioned the Rhodian ships on his right flank and the Pontic ships on his left, while the rest were set behind them as reserves. The logic is that, reading the paradosis, each of the ships on Caesar’s flanks would have exactly one assigned to it as a reserve, with nine Rhodian and eight Pontic ships (=17) supported by five Lycian and twelve Asian ships (=17). “Trop séduisante,” notes Andrieu, suggesting that one can only infer a minimum of 34 ships, as the text does not require a one-to-one correspondence between lines.} This would explain why the forces of 13.5 differ from those of 1.1 and provide grounds for rejecting Schneider’s attempt to smooth over these differences.\par
There remains one important question to answer: is there anything inherently implausible in Caesar having a handful of ships from Lycia? Lycia, granted, is mentioned nowhere else in the Caesarean corpus, and \cite{Townend}, for one, finds the paradosis objectionable “since Lycia was not a Roman province at this time.”\footnote{Townend, 1988, {\itshape Caesar’s War in Alexandria}, Bristol: 44} That, however, does not preclude the possibility of raising ships from Lycia if, as Cicero tells us ({\itshape Att}. 9.9.2), Lycia was one of the sources for Pompey’s fleet just a few years earlier. Moreover, a recently published Greek inscription on bronze shows that Caesar presided over the negotiation of a generous treaty with the Lycians in 46 BCE, which several historians have interpreted as a reward for the contingent of ships that (according to the pre-Schneider text of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}) Lycia sent to Egypt.\footnote{\textit{Editio princeps} and discussion in S. Mitchell, 2005, “The Treaty between Rome and Lycia of 46 BC (MS2070),” {\itshape Papyri Graecae Schøyen (P. Schøyen I)}, ed. R. Pintaudi, Florence: 161–259, with reference to the position of Lycia and the ships sent to Egypt at 234–37. Both P. Sánchez, 2007 “La convention judiciaire dans le traité conclu entre Rome et les Lyciens (P.Schøyen I 25),” {\itshape Chiron} 37 363–381 at 364 and Isaías Arrayás Morales, 2010, “Diplomacy in the Greek Poleis of Asia Minor: Mytilene’s Embassy to Tarraco,” {\itshape C\&M} 61: 127–149, at 133 n. 19 also point to the Lycian ships in connection with the treaty.}\par
In sum, it appears that the basis of Schneider’s conjecture is unreliable at best, and that the paradosis, far from being historically objectionable, may actually illuminate the condition of Romano-Lycian relations in the time of Caesar.

\noindent Paragraphs 17–22 contain the narrative of a series of chaotic episodes that together amount to the \textit{aduersa} summarized at 23.1 (\textit{Alexandrini cum Romanos et secundis rebus confirmari et aduersis incitari uiderent}) and stand in contrast to the \textit{secunda} represented by the naval battle of chapters 15–16. Despite the clear statement of Caesar’s objective at the outset (17.1 {\itshape ut insulam molemque … in suam redigeret potestatem}), the sequence of events is hard to discern, particularly in paragraphs 17 and 22.\footnote{The objective itself is clear but the meaning of \textit{hoc} is hard to discern. It obviously points to the immediately preceding 16.7: \textit{Reliquae propinquam fugam ad oppidum capiunt. Quas protexerunt ex molibus atque aedificiis imminentibus et nostros adire propius prohibuerunt}. But the referent of \textit{oppidum} could be either Alexandria itself (see below for the references) or the \textit{uicus oppidi magnitudine} ({\itshape BC} 3.112.3) on the island. \xref{Schiller1890b}{Schiller} (1890b, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101073027086?urlappend=\%3Bseq=556}{542}) opts for the latter: “er wollte verhindern dass das Feind \uline{auf der Insel} wieder eine Zuflucht finden könnte,” but the \textit{aedificia imminentia} mentioned at 16.7 underlie the later comparison between the island and the city (18.1 \textit{etsi erat non dissimile atque Alexandriae genus aedificiorum, ut minora maioribus conferantur, turresque editae et coniunctae muri locum obtinebant}) and therefore ought to refer to the city. This would suggest that \textit{hoc} refers to \textit{protexerunt ex molibus atque aedificiis imminentibus et nostros adire propius prohibuerunt}, not to taking refuge.\label{stab17.2-note2}} Crucial bits of information have been omitted or lost from the text, and it is not always easy to decide between omission and loss. The present passage contains two such gaps.\par
The first gap is easy to see, if not to fix: the phrase \textit{uno tempore} suggests that two or more simultaneous actions are in prospect here, and yet in the sentence as transmitted the only action mentioned is an attack on a vaguely defined \textit{illa}: \textit{perfectis … munitionibus in oppido et illa in urbe}({\itshape m}) \textit{uno tempore temptari posse confidebat} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{Caesar}). This sentence has other problems as well:\begin{enumerate}
\item[a] The two branches of the tradition are split between \textit{in urbe} (MU) and \textit{in urbem} (STV). The latter, which makes poor sense with \textit{temptari}, seems likely to have been archetypal, with \textit{in urbe} as an innovation based on \textit{in oppido}.
\item[b] The antecedent of \textit{illa} is obscure. Some editors take it to be the island and the jetty together and replace \textit{in} with \textit{et} to produce the two actions called for by \textit{uno tempore}: Caesar projects simultaneous attacks on the island with its adjoining jetty and the city of Alexandria.\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} prints \textit{et illa et urbem} and calls this repair “grammaticalement très satisfaisante” (p. 78) but translates \textit{et illam et urbem}: “il comptait pouvoir se porter contre \uline{l’ile} en même temps que contre la ville.”} The \textit{et … et} construction is well paralleled in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} (3.1 \textit{uno … tempore et nostras munitiones infestabant et suas defendebant}, 7.3 \textit{cum uero uno tempore et natio eorum et natura cognoscatur}, 17.4 \textit{Vno enim tempore et ex tectis aedificiorum propugnabant et litora armati defendebant}), but there are no good parallels in the corpus for a neuter plural pronoun with two feminine antecedents.\footnote{According to \cite{Pinkster} (2015, 1258), the construction occurs only from Sallust onwards.} The best one can do is point to 24.4 \textit{si illa sentiret}, where the antecendent of \textit{illa} is vague, and {\itshape BG} 1.27.4 \textit{dum ea conquiruntur}, where the antecedent of \textit{ea} is the preceding \textit{obsides arma seruos}. \cite{Fleischer} fixes the problem with the obvious \textit{illas}, but this form leaves the origin of \textit{in} obscure (1878, 279). \cite{Nipperdey} takes the antecedent of \textit{illa} to be \textit{molem} and construes the pronoun as an ablative: Caesar projects an attack on Alexandria from the jetty. Nipperdey obtains the two actions required here by emending \textit{et} to \textit{etiam} and excising \textit{in}: \textit{etiam illa urbem uno tempore temptari posse confidebat}. With this reading the possibility of attacking the city is an afterthought to the aforementioned project of attacking the island and jetty, which does not work very well with \textit{uno tempore}.\footnote{As \cite{Larsen} notes, however, this ablative is “nimis audax, nec sine difficultate uerbis {\itshape perfectis … oppido} interiectis in {\itshape illa} audiri potest {\itshape moles}” (1886, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=16}{13}). \cite{Hoffmann1890} simplifies the construction, if not the transmission history, by adding \textit{ex} before \textit{illa}.}
\item[c] The word \textit{urbem} is awkward since Incertus has just referred to Alexandria with \textit{in oppido}.\footnote{\cite{Kraffert}’s suggestion (1882, 76) that the \textit{urbs} is the settlement on Pharus (see above \ref{stab17.2-note2}) while \textit{oppidum} is Alexandria seems far-fetched. \cite{Oudendorp} suggests emending \textit{in urbem} to \textit{in turrem} “{\itshape sc}. \textit{in molem in qua erat turris},” but a reference to the lighthouse, which Caesar already controls ({\itshape BC} 3.112.5), seems unhelpful and the expression is implausibly indirect.} It is true that he uses both \textit{urbs} (1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 12.4, 13.2) and \textit{oppidum/oppidani} (1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 7.2, 15.8, 18.3, 19.2, 19.3, 19.5, 32.1, 32.3, 32.4) when speaking of Alexandria, sometimes in close proximity (1.5), but the terms are never elsewhere close together in a passage where anything other than Alexandria itself is in view.\footnote{The referent of \textit{oppidum} at 16.7 (\textit{reliquae} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{naues}] \textit{propinquam fugam ad oppidum capiunt}) is unclear (see note \ref{stab17.2-note2}).}
\end{enumerate}\par
\cite{Aldus} proposed a relatively simple solution to the problem(s) of \textit{illa} and provided the desired doubling:

\begin{quote}et illam et urbem uno tempore temptari posse confidebat.\end{quote}

\noindent This repair implies a corruption originating in an easy misreading of \textit{illam} as \textit{illa in}. The expression \textit{in urbe}, parellel to \textit{in oppido}, made the second \textit{et} superfluous, hence its omission. Some qualms remain, however. First, the antecedent of \textit{illam} is still unclear: \textit{insula} or \textit{moles}? (\cite{Jurinius} proposed emending \textit{illa in} to \textit{insulam} to bring clarity on this point.) More substantially, the idea of attacking the city is irrelevant to the objective announced at the start of the paragraph, which targets the island and jetty. What Incertus says about Alexandria is that Caesar’s fortifications there are nearly complete, and the \textit{munitiones} in question serve to protect against attacks, in line with Caesar’s overall strategy of keeping his troops safe until reinforcements arrive ({\itshape BC} 3.112.5–6, {\itshape BAlex} 1.1–2), not to support attacks. And in fact no attacks in or against the city itself are mentioned in the remaining portions of the Alexandrian war.\footnote{\cite{Larsen}’s explanation, “neque hoc quisquam miretur, cur in iis, quae sequuntur, nullam urbis (i.e. Alexandriae) oppugnationem diserte commemoret Hirtius, assidue enim in urbe pugnabatur, etiamsi aliis locis fortunam experiebantur Romani, idque ex {\itshape B. Alex}. XV, 2 apparet” (1886, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=17}{14}), does not square well with \textit{temptari}.} The fighting in chapters 17–22 is concentrated on the island and the jetty, and the military actions thereafter occur well outside of the city, in Pelusium, at the tip of the Delta, and near the Nile.\par
Attempts on the problem of \textit{urbem} have been made via emendations to \textit{temptari}: \cite{Jurinius} for example proposed emending it to \textit{tutari}. But the idea of protection is at odds with both the general context of attack and the expression \textit{uno tempore}.\footnote{And anyway \textit{tueri} would be the \textit{mot propre}: (cf., e.g., {\itshape BC} 2.10.1, 2.32.3, 3.23.2, 3.111.6, Hirt. 8.34.4). \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=634}{556}), starting with \cite{Nipperdey}’s text, altered \textit{temptari} to \textit{intrari} (\textit{etiam illa} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{mole}] \textit{in urbem intrari}), and this text is further modified by \cite{Kraffert} (\textit{et} [= \textit{etiam}] \textit{in illa} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{insula}] \textit{urbem intrari}).} Given the military objective announced at the beginning of the chapter, it seems unwise to tamper with \textit{temptari}. \textit{Tempto} is used with a variety of objects, among them places (\textit{loca}, {\itshape BG} 7.86.4; \textit{Galliam Italiamque}, {\itshape BC} 1.29.3) and fortifications (\textit{moenia oppidi}, {\itshape BC} 3.40.1; \textit{opera nostra}, {\itshape BG} 7.73.1, cf. 7.84.2).\footnote{\cite{Schiller1890b} (1890b, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101073027086?urlappend=\%3Bseq=556}{542}) supplies one from a different category in an implausibly elaborate repair: \textit{… munitionibus} [\textit{in oppido}] \textit{et} \supplied{\textit{in}} \textit{illa} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{insula}) \textit{et in urbe uno tempore} \supplied{\textit{fortunam}} \textit{temptari posse confidebat}.}\par
Another approach would be to assume that the missing parallel for \textit{et illa}(\textit{m}) was lost in an eye-skip from \textit{et} to \textit{et}. The pronoun’s obscurity would be clarified if what was lost was \textit{hac} or \textit{hanc}. Incertus’ usage elsewhere suggests that \textit{et ha}({\itshape n}){\itshape c} preceded \textit{et illa}({\itshape m}) (cf. 6.3 {\itshape haec propior … illa inferior}, 13.1 {\itshape has … illas}, 19.2 {\itshape hunc … illum}). As between the accusative and the ablative, the accusative seems preferable given the aforementioned objections to seeing \textit{urbem} as a subject for \textit{temptari}. This leaves the problem of \textit{urbe}(\textit{m}): where did it come from? Perhaps it was spawned when the final \textit{m} of \textit{illam} was misread as \textit{in} (as was mentioned above), or perhaps — after the loss of \textit{et hanc} — \textit{urbem} was added as a gloss for the now lonely \textit{illam} based on an antithesis with \textit{in oppido}.\par
With these repairs the sentence reads:

\begin{quote}Perfectis enim magna ex parte munitionibus in oppido, \supplied{et hanc} et illam \surplus{urbem} uno tempore temptari posse confidebat.\end{quote}


\begin{quote}For since he had mostly completed his works in the town, he was confident that an attempt could be made on both the latter ({\itshape sc}. the jetty) and the former ({\itshape sc}. the island) at the same time.\end{quote}

\noindent As the narrative continues, Caesar attacks the island (17–18) then the jetty (19–21). This does not square perfectly with \textit{uno tempore}, but the misfit is at least partly a result of the gaps in the narrative in the following sentence and at 17.6.\par
The second gap pertains to the two-pronged attack itself. In the passage as transmitted we hear that Caesar, hoping to split the enemy force, sent decked ships to attack one part of the island, and that he encouraged the men in his own divided force to compete with one another for the rewards that would be given to whichever group first took control of the island: 

\begin{quote}In alteram insulae partem distinendae manus causa constratis nauibus aggreditur praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.\end{quote}

\noindent The construction \textit{in … insulae partem … aggreditur} is problematic — although for a similar anacoluthon see 26.2 — but the bigger problem here is the absence of any reference to the other part of the island, presumably the part that the large force of men (ten cohorts plus light infantry and select cavalry, presumably on foot) embarked on the smaller vessels and skiffs was to attack. Since this area is the focus of the main battle narrative starting at 17.5, its omission here is odd.\par
\cite{Aldus} repaired the smaller problem by excising the unwanted preposition, \cite{Oudendorp} by converting it into an adverb, \textit{inde}. \cite{Vascosanus}, who accepted Aldus’ emendation, addressed the larger problem by adding a connective before \textit{alteram} and repunctuating so as to join this sentence to its predecessor:

\begin{quote}… cohortes X … in nauigia minora scaphasque imponit: \surplus{in} alteram\supplied{que} insulae partem distinendae manus causa constratis nauibus aggreditur praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.\footnote{Vascosanus’ repair presupposes the loss of \textit{-que}, which may be related to the appearance of a surplus \textit{-que} later in the sentence: praemiis {\itshape ed. pr.} : praemiisque {\itshape MUSTV.}}\end{quote}

\noindent \cite{Castiglioni} combined the two approaches, replacing \textit{in} with \textit{et}:

\begin{quote}… cohortes X … in nauigia minora scaphasque imponit et alteram insulae partem distinendae manus causa constratis nauibus aggreditur praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.\end{quote}

\noindent With both repairs the fact that the ten cohorts (etc.) make an attack elsewhere has to be deduced from \textit{alteram}. The innovations implicit in these repairs are not impossible, but they are not particularly plausible, either. Furthermore, there are no good parallels for the elision of the second \textit{alter}- in the corpus. The closest is 1.5 \textit{ex altera oppidi parte auxilia ferri posset}, but there the solo \textit{altera} depends on the preceding \textit{in duas partes esset urbs diuisa}.\footnote{Similarly 34.3 {\itshape legiones … duas … quarum altera}. The closest parallel for our passage is probably {\itshape BG} 7.44.3–4, but there the reference of the solo {\itshape ad alteram oppidi partem} is defined by contrast with Caesar’s own position.}\par
Another approach is to assume another eye-skip here resulting in a lacuna that one might fill thus:

\begin{quote}… cohortes X … in nauigia minora scaphasque imponit. In alteram insulae partem \supplied{pedestres copias exponit, alteram partem} distinendae manus causa constratis nauibus aggreditur praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.\end{quote}

\noindent This supplement makes use of the transmitted preposition \textit{in} and provides a second \textit{alteram}, thereby specifying the attack’s two approaches, which the enemies withstand \textit{pariter} in 17.4 (\textit{ac primo impetum nostrorum pariter sustinuerunt}). Its language has acceptable parallels, too, since Incertus uses the expression \textit{copiae pedestres} twice, once in an antithesis with naval forces (44.1 \textit{partim classe per se, partim pedestribus copiis per barbaros}, cf. also 64.1), and mentions troop landings twice (10.2 {\itshape remiges in terram … exposuisset}, 19.3 \textit{cohortium instar in terram exposuerat}). But at least two aspects of the supplement give pause. First, the hypothesized skip goes from \textit{partem} to \textit{partem}, yet the second \textit{partem} is unnecessary and probably unwanted: in comparable constructions Incertus omits the second substantive (1.5 \textit{alterius rei … alterius}, 11.4 \textit{una hostium triremis … altera}, 19.5 \textit{altero opere effecto … alter instituto}, 28.3 \textit{unum latus … alterum}). However, the pleonasm is paralleled at {\itshape BG} 1.2.3 \textit{una ex parte … altera ex parte} (cf. also {\itshape BG} 4.3.3). Second, one misses the connective provided by earlier repairs. So the supplement can only be offered \textit{exempli gratia}.\par
On balance, however, it seems better to indicate a gap than to apply a superficial repair.

\noindent The personal use of \textit{afuerunt} and the shift from secondary to primary sequence in the first sentence prompted \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, 558–60) to replace the main verb with an impersonal \textit{afuit} and deal with \textit{fecerint} and the subsequent problem spots by excising \textit{incensi … ut}. His explanation for the genesis of this long stretch of text is not particularly plausible, however, and the shift of sequence is paralleled at Suet. {\itshape Tib}. 50.1 (\textit{Iuliae uxori tantum afuit ut relegatae … offici aut humanitatis aliquid impertiret ut … commercio hominum frui uetuerit}; cf. also Suet. {\itshape Vesp}. 14.1). \textit{Afuerunt} remains anomalous, but it is hard to believe that so strange a usage arose as a gloss or scribal emendation. It is best left alone.\par
The principal problem here is obvious: the middle sentence does not have a main clause. Nor can its pieces easily be attached to what precedes or follows. The prior sentence concerns Roman attacks on Alexandrian positions, while the sentence under consideration involves Alexandrian sallies. The following sentence is a general assessment of the situation: Caesar’s men were dangerously eager to fight. The lacuna (on which see further below) creates uncertainty about what \textit{quandocumque fors obtulerat} modifies: the closest verbal forms pertain to the Alexandrians (\textit{procurrentibus}, \textit{erumpentibus}), but the context is about Roman risk-taking, so it seems more likely to modify a verb in the lacuna.\footnote{Thus \cite{Carter} 1997: “In the daily encounters, whenever the occasion offered, when the Alexandrians ran forward and made sorties, \supplied{our men were passionately keen to take the chance of fighting}. \cite{Andrieu} translates otherwise: “Toutes les fois que dans les combats quotidiens le hasard avait permis aux Alexandrins de s’élancer et de faire une sortie, leur troupe [\gap{}] était arrêtée par les travaux [\gap{}], par le zèle ardent de nos soldats.” He adds, optimistically, “le sens est apparent.”}\par
\cite{Stephanus} proposed putting a lacuna before \textit{manum}:

\begin{quote}In proeliis cotidianis, quandocumque fors obtulerat, procurrentibus et erumpentibus Alexandrinis, \gap{} manum comprehendi multum operibus et ardentibus studiis militum.\footnote{\cite{Klotz} and \cite{Andrieu} credit \cite{Stephanus} with two lacunas and misplace both. The lacunas in their texts are \cite{Nipperdey}’s: “lacunas ego significaui” ad loc. He explains them in his prefatory “Quaestiones Caesarianae” (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=201}{193}).}\end{quote}

\noindent \label{stba22.2-lacuna}What precedes this lacuna is clear enough, but the string of words after it form an implausible ensemble: it is odd to have a band of men enclosed by fortifications (\textit{manum comprehendi … operibus}), and \textit{multum} is anomalously placed after whatever it modifies.\footnote{Adverbial \textit{multum} never follows the word it modifies in the Caesarian corpus. It precedes even at 75.3 \textit{multum adiuuante natura loci}, despite the potential for bracketing here. For the adjective, there are a few examples (e.g., {\itshape BHisp} 11.2 \textit{ignemque multum miserunt}).\label{stba22.2-multum}} If \textit{manum} does mean “band” here (see further below), it seems more likely to refer to one of the groups making the sorties. Furthermore, the apparent parallel between fortifications (\textit{operibus}) and emotions (\textit{studiis}) is hard to credit.\par
To fix the former problem \cite{Nipperdey} indicated a lacuna between \textit{manum} and \textit{comprehendi}, proposing \supplied{\textit{conserentes}} or something similar in the first lacuna to govern \textit{manum}, which now refers to combat, not troops:

\begin{quote}In proeliis cotidianis, quandocumque fors obtulerat, procurrentibus et erumpentibus Alexandrinis, manum \gap{} comprehendi multum operibus \gap{} et ardentibus studiis militum.\end{quote}

\noindent The sense is good, the expression, although more Livian than Caesarian, does occur in the corpus (71.2 \textit{ut celerius omnium opinione manum consereret}, {\itshape BC} 1.21.3), and the lacuna can be explained as originating in an eye-skip from \textit{con}- to \textit{com}-. As for the remaining words, \cite{Nipperdey} suggested that the first three originated in something like \textit{Caesar comprehendi multum operibus noluit}. This required the second lacuna shown above, to separate \textit{operibus} and \textit{studiis}, since the latter makes no sense with \textit{comprehendi}. \cite{Nipperdey}’s text is accepted by subsequent editors, including \cite{Klotz} and \cite{Andrieu}. However, his explanation of \textit{comprehendi multum operibus} seems unlikely, in that the most recently mentioned \textit{opera} were protecting the Alexandrians, not Caesar. Furthermore, it would be nice to have one problem spot instead of two. So it is worth trying to come up with a better explanation for the words after \cite{Nipperdey}’s first lacuna.\par
The expression \textit{quandocumque fors} \textit{obtulerant}, with its pluperfect verb, suggests that verb in the lacuna will be an imperfect indicative (cf., e.g., {\itshape BAlex} 2.5 \textit{alias ambulatorias} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{turres}) \textit{… in quamcumque erat uisum partem mouebant}, {\itshape BC} 2.41.4 \textit{hi quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant, hostes loco cedere cogebant}).\footnote{The Caesarian corpus supplies several parallels for this use of \textit{fors} ({\itshape BG} 2.21.1, 7.873, Hirt. 8.18.7).} In place of \cite{Nipperdey}’s participle therefore, we might try:\par
1) \textit{manum} \supplied{\textit{conserere optabant}} (cf. Hirt. 8.41.2 \textit{hoc fonte prohiberi posse oppidanos cum optarent reliqui}, from a passage that has much in common with the one under consideration and will be cited again below). Or:\par
2) \textit{manum} \supplied{\textit{conserendam conclamabant}} (cf. {\itshape BG} 3.18.5 \textit{conclamant omnes occasionem negotii bene gerendi amittendam non esse, ad castra iri oportere})\par
Neither is quite right in a sentence that begins \textit{In proeliis cotidianis}. Better:\par
3) \textit{manum} \supplied{\textit{conserere properabant}} (cf. 20.2 \textit{naues … a terra repellere properabant}).\footnote{In place of \textit{properabant} one could supply \textit{contendebant}, which also takes a complementary infinitive (e.g., {\itshape BG} 3.15.1 {\itshape milites … transcendere in hostium naues contendebant … barbari … fuga salutem petere contendebant}, cf. {\itshape BC} 1.58.1), but the imperfect is less common in this construction than the perfect.}\par
If the lacuna did originate in an eye-skip, it is difficult to determine its length. But the words that come after the lacuna provide some clues as to its contents.\par
1) If we make Caesarian soldiers the subject of the verb in the lacuna, we also need something that changes the subject, or at least the focalization, since these eager soldiers are later referred to in the genitive (\textit{ardentibus studiis militum}). In the Hirtius passage just mentioned (8.41.2), which continues \textit{Caesar unus uideret} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{eos prohiberi posse}), the focalization shifts from \textit{reliqui} to \textit{Caesar}, as it often does in passages in which Caesar overrules the impetuous desires of his men (e.g., {\itshape BC} 1.71–72 \textit{id … ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur … Caesar in eam spem uenerat se sine pugna et sine uulnere suorum rem conficere posse}; cf. {\itshape BG} 6.34.7, {\itshape BC} 3.74.2–3, {\itshape BAfr} 82.2–3 and, with the roles reversed, {\itshape BC} 1.64.2–3).\par
2) The infinitive \textit{comprehendi} needs a subject and something to govern it. For the former, the most likely candidates are people (cf. 55.1, {\itshape BG} 4.27.3, etc.) or places (cf. {\itshape BC} 3.46.6 \textit{aliis comprehensis collibus}).\footnote{The passages in which \textit{comprehendi} is used of things catching fire do not seem to offer any way to use \textit{operibus}, let alone \textit{ardentibus studiis}: {\itshape BG} 5.43.2 \textit{hae} (sc. \textit{casae}) \textit{celeriter ignem comprehenderunt}, {\itshape BC} 3.101.4 \textit{flamma ab utroque cornu comprehensa naues sunt combustae quinque}, Hirt. 8.43.3 \textit{opera flamma comprehensa partim restinguunt, partim interscindunt}.} When applied to people the verb usually means “round up and put under arrest,” which does not suit the present passage, but {\itshape BC} 3.65.2 \textit{cuius aduentus Pompeianos compressit nostrosque firmauit} offers a parallel for the meaning “check,” which might work. However, the verb’s use with places also suits the situation on the ground in Alexandria: Caesar’s objective is not to encircle the Alexandrians with defensive works but to increase the space that he himself controls by building defensive works around it (cf. {\itshape BC} 3.112.7 \textit{Caesar loca maxime necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit}\footnote{The strategy announced here plays out in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, which shows him taking control of the palace area first (1.2–5, esp. \textit{munitiones cotidie operibus augentur}), then Pharos Island and the Heptastadion (17.1–2, 19–21).} ); he is trying to keep his men safe until reinforcements arrive ({\itshape BC} 3.112.5–6, {\itshape BAlex} 1.1–2), as they will do shortly (28.1–2). As for what governs \textit{comprehendi}, the possibilities are obviously numerous.\par
3) The phrase \textit{operibus atque ardentibus studiis} needs to be made plausible. At present \textit{operibus} most naturally refers to the Alexandrian fortifications just mentioned (\textit{in expugnandis operibus}), which make an awkward pair with the enthusiasm of Roman soldiers. If, however, the \textit{opera} are Roman and parallel to the \textit{studia}, as \textit{laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem} in the following sentence suggests, the phrase here is oddly imbalanced.\footnote{For the combination of morale and effort cf. Hirt. 8.41.3 \textit{non deterrentur tamen milites nostri vineas proferre et labore atque operibus locorum vincere difficultates}.}\par
4) The mysterious \textit{diuulgata} in the following sentence needs a textual anchor; at present it is hard to see anything that it might refer to, since the previously mentioned Caesarian exhortations mentioned occurred in earlier battles, one a success (15.5), one a failure (20.1, 21.1). It ought to point to something that Caesar says in this episode, something that aligns with the resulting \textit{labor} and \textit{pugnandi cupiditas}, and can perhaps be located in the word that governs \textit{comprehendi}.\par
So one might fill the lacuna thus, \textit{exempli gratia}:

\begin{quote}In proeliis cotidianis, quandocumque fors obtulerat, procurrentibus et erumpentibus Alexandrinis, manum \supplied{conserere properabant omnes, Caesar autem contendebat hostes (\textit{or} loca illa) posse} comprehendi multum operibus et ardentibus studiis militum. Nec diuulgata Caesaris hortatio subsequi legionum aut laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem, ut magis deterrendi et continendi a periculosissimis essent dimicationibus quam incitandi ad pugnandum.\end{quote}

\noindent This is a minimalist stopgap; the lacuna might be longer. Caesar’s repeated utterance (\textit{contendebat}) is (a gesture towards) \textit{diuulgata hortatio} desiderated above.\footnote{For \textit{contendere} with a dependent accusative/infinitive cf. 67.1 \textit{quod ei neque legibus neque moribus concessum esse ceteri tetrarchae contendebant} (also {\itshape BG} 1.31.2, 5.6.3, 6.37.7, 6.41.4, etc.). The scenario suggested here is rather implausible as it stands—Caesar and his soldiers do not usually squabble over strategy on the field of battle—but that is perhaps due to its abbreviation. (For a one-time squabble, however, see the peculiar opening of the battle of Thapsus: {\itshape BAfr} 82.2–3 Cum idem a pluribus animaduerti coeptum esset, subito legati euocatique obsecrare Caesarem ne dubitaret signum dare: uictoriam sibi propriam a dis immortalibus portendi. \uline{Dubitante Caesare atque eorum studio cupiditatique resistente sibique eruptione pugnari non placere clamitante, etiam atque etiam aciem sustentante,} subito dextro cornu iniussu Caesaris tubicen a militibus coactus canere coepit.) In our passage he might have exhorted his men to redouble their efforts to retake the fortifications on the bridge instead of fighting outside the fortifications, and followed this up with the explanation in the text.} But there remains (at least) one fly in the ointment: the anomalous position of \textit{multum} (see above, note \ref{stba22.2-multum}). What we really want is a modifier for \textit{operibus}, both to sever the connection with the Alexandrian \textit{opera} and to balance \textit{ardentibus studiis}. A passage just cited, 1.2. \textit{munitiones cotidie operibus augentur}, suggests the following:

\begin{quote}… Caesar autem contendebat hostes (\textit{or} loca illa) posse> comprehendi munitionum operibus et ardentibus studiis militum.\end{quote}

\noindent The verbal parallel is not perfect but the sense is decent and there is a similar combination of \textit{opus}, \textit{munitio}, and \textit{milites} at {\itshape BG} 1.8.4 \textit{operis munitione et militum concursu et telis repulsi} (sc. \textit{Heluetii}), a parallel that gives a slight edge to \textit{hostes} over \textit{loca} as the subject of \textit{comprehendi}. All of our desiderata have now been met.\par
This extended discussion has shown that \cite{Nipperdey}’s second lacuna is in the wrong place and may not be necessary. The remaining options seem to be these:\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] Place the second lacuna after \textit{multum} to give room for the word it modifies. Or
\item[2] Obelize \textit{multum}. The argument for emending it to \textit{munitionum} is a bit wobbly, hence the obelus.
\end{enumerate}\par
As between these two, our preference goes to the latter as being more likely to stimulate further work on this spot, which has been untouched since 1847. With our \textit{exempli gratia} supplement it reads as follows:

\begin{quote}Hoc detrimento milites nostri tantum afuerunt ut perturbarentur ut incensi atque incitati magnas accessiones fecerint in operibus hostium expugnandis. (2) In proeliis cotidianis, quandocumque fors obtulerat, procurrentibus et erumpentibus Alexandrinis, manum \supplied{conserere properabant omnes, Caesar autem contendebat hostes posse} comprehendi \sic{multum} operibus et ardentibus studiis militum. Nec diuulgata Caesaris hortatio subsequi legionum aut laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem, ut magis deterrendi et continendi a periculosissimis essent dimicationibus quam incitandi ad pugnandum.\end{quote}


\begin{quote}Our men were so far from being thrown into confusion by this defeat that, roused and provoked, they made extra efforts in attacking the enemy’s fortifications. (2) In the daily battles, whenever a chance had come their way, with the Alexandrians running forward and making sorties, \supplied{they would all would rush into} combat. \supplied{Caesar, however, insisted that it was possible for the enemy} to be checked \sic{greatly} by fortifications and the burning eagerness of the soldiers. Nor was Caesar’s widespread exhortation able to attain the level of the legions’ effort or desire for fighting, so that they had to be deterred and restrained from exceptionally dangerous forms of combat rather than worked up for fighting.\end{quote}

\noindent 1. Paragraph 26 of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} presents four primary difficulties, all indicated by problems of syntax or style rather than by discrepancies in the manuscript tradition: first, the tense of \textit{adducit}, which stands alone as a present-tense verb amid perfect-tense verbs both in the previous section and in the following clauses of paragraph 26; second, the absolute usage of \textit{adducit}, which is found in all the manuscripts but not used absolutely in an active form elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus; third, the strange placement and syntax of \textit{Achillae}, a proper noun that contributes little except a reminder of the identity of the enemy in the passage (and, because of this mnemonic value, may have originated as a helpful gloss provided by a later hand); fourth, the difficult phrase \textit{multiplici praesidio}, which must either be understood in a \textit{constructio ad sensum} as an ablative absolute with a plural participle \textit{propugnantibus} or be suspected as a gloss.\par
The present tense of \textit{adducit}, upon first analysis, appears problematic because of the perfect-tense verbs that both precede and follow the verb and enmesh it within a narrative of perfective aspect; additionally, \textit{adducit} is linked to the subsequent \textit{redegit} and \textit{collocauit} by the conjunction -\textit{que}, which typically joins balanced or parallel elements.\footnote{It should be noted that, although the punctuation of this edition of the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} separates paragraph 26 into two distinct sentences and includes a full stop after \textit{adducit}, the close connection between the verbs indicated by the \textit{idque} and the desired balance between tenses within the paragraph remains. Other editions, including that of \cite{Aldus}, have presented this entire passage as a single sentence. On the punctuation policy applied here see Damon 2015a, lxv–lxvi.} \cite{Aldus}, therefore, emended the verb to \textit{adduxit}; one may cite as a parallel \textit{adduxit} at 43.4, where it appears in a nexus of other perfect-tense verbs.\par
However, a parallel for the mixture of tenses linked by a -\textit{que} is found elsewhere within the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, as for example at 61.4:

\begin{quote}Hunc Marcellus insequitur et quam proxime potest Vliam castra castris confert locorumque cognita natura, quo maxime rem deducere uolebat necessitate est deductus, ut neque confligeret—cuius si rei facultas esset, resistere incitatis militibus non poterat—neque uagari Cassium latius pateretur, ne plures ciuitates ea paterentur quae passi erant Cordubenses.\end{quote}

\noindent Both \textit{insequitur} and \textit{confert} are present-tense main verbs, and they are linked—after an ablative absolute and a relative clause—by a -\textit{que} with the perfect passive \textit{est deductus}, clearly in secondary sequence as it is followed by imperfect subjunctives.\par
But why the mixture of tenses? For paragraph 26, the most probable explanation is the vividness of the present tense, which complements the dramatic staging of the introductory phrase \textit{sub idem tempus}. This same opening hook is used five times in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} (at 26.1, 28.1, 40.1, 42.1, 64.2), and two of these passages have clear present-tense verbs (28.1 \textit{proficiscitur}, 40.1 \textit{concurritur}), one includes an ambiguous form (64.2 \textit{uenit}), and one a perfect passive (42.1 \textit{acceptum est}). In those cases where \textit{sub idem tempus} introduces a verb of present (or potentially-present) tense, the surrounding sentences include a medley of perfect and imperfect tense verbs, as occurs in paragraph 26. Additionally, \textit{adducit}, being itself a verb of motion, seems to have a kinship with the first three examples of the present/potentially-present variety, offering the action anticipated by the opening phrase.\par
There is clearly, then, no problem with the \textit{tense} of \textit{adducit} in this passage, and \cite{Aldus}' emendation may be set aside, though it remains a helpful diagnostic emendation.\par
2. The next problem likewise centers upon {\itshape adducit}, but is a matter of syntax not tense. The verb {\itshape adduco} is inherently transitive\footnote{Present forms of the simplex verb \textit{duco} do occur in Latin literature absolutely with directional constructions, wherein the context is a military general leading his troops ({\itshape cf}. {\itshape TLL} 5.1.2142.30–50). Two examples may be provided from Livy: 1.23.5 \textit{ducit quam proxime ad hostem potest}, and 2.39.5 \textit{postremum ad urbem a Pedo ducit, et ad fossas Cluilias quinque ab urbe milia passuum castris positis}). While \textit{adduco} is a compound of this verb, the {\itshape TLL} reports only passive forms used absolutely ({\itshape cf. TLL} 1.0.602.70–603.5).}; there are fifteen uses within the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, eight of which are finite and active; all eight of these have their own direct objects (2.2, 34.5, 35.2, 42.4, 43.4, 58.1, 62.1, 68.1). The present sentence lacks a direct object to complete the sense of \textit{adducit}. The ablative of accompaniment \textit{cum magnis copiis} demonstrates that Mithridates was not proceeding towards Egypt alone, but does not fulfill the need of the verb \textit{adducit} for an object. Various repairs have been proposed\footnote{\cite{Fleischer} provides an effective overview of suggestions predating the end of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century, and concludes with Fleischer’s own well-supported correction to the text. Authors of emendations include \cite{Stephanus}, \cite{Vascosanus}, \cite{Schneider}, \cite{Dinter}, \cite{Vielhaber1869}, and \cite{Fleischer} himself, as well as Glandorp, Davisius, Landgraf, and \cite{Klotz}.} , but attempts to repair the syntax have primarily taken two paths: the first method is to alter the verb \textit{adducit} to a less transitive verb, the second to emend in such a way as to provide the verb with a direct object.\par
The following four emendations adapt the syntax according to the first method.\par
a. \cite{Dauisius1727}, in his second edition of 1727, first suggested that \textit{adducit} be replaced with \textit{aduenit}, an intransitive verb. This suggestion was followed by both \cite{Schneider} (1888) and \cite{Klotz} (1927), and is attractive for its simplicity, but it must be noted that \textit{aduenio} is not found as a finite verb in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, and is only found twice in participial form (32.3 \textit{dignum adueniens fructum uirtutis et animi magnitudinis tulit} and, later in the same passage, \textit{aduenienti Caesari occurrerunt seque ei dediderunt}). In neither of these instances is a destination designated, although parallel—albeit, again, participial—forms of \textit{aduenio} with attendant accusatives of place do appear at Liu. 42.56.3 (\textit{M. Lucretius, Chalcidem adueniens … nuntium, praetoris uerbis qui abscedere eum inde iuberet, misit}) and 44.30.9 (\textit{Carauantium in Cauiis Durnium oppidum aduenientem benigne accepit}; see further {\itshape TLL} 1.831.40–50). Overall, participial forms are far more common in the Caesarian corpus (participial forms occurring at {\itshape BC} 2.32.12, twice at {\itshape BAlex} 32.3, {\itshape BAfr} 11.2, 23.2, 74.2, 89.2; only once in a finite form at {\itshape BAfr} 7.3). The infrequency of this verb with an accusative of destination, as well as the apparent preference for the verb in its participial form, together justify editors in continuing to search for alternative solutions.\par
b. \cite{Vielhaber1869}’s emendation, though made over a century later, closely corresponds with that of \cite{Dauisius1727}, and thus should be treated next. He emended the text to read \textit{ad Pelusium uenit}, arguing that there was a transposition of the preposition \textit{ad}, which later led to a misconstrual of the verb: \textit{ad Pelusium uenit} became \textit{Pelusium ad uenit} and, because the verb \textit{uenit} would have been abbreviated as \textit{uēit}, the text would resemble \textit{Pelusium aduēit}, easily (mis)read as “\textit{Pelusium aducit}.” \cite{Vielhaber1869} cited 36.3 as a model for this passage (\textit{magnis et continuis itineribus confectis cum aduentaret ad Nicopolim}). His paleographic explanation is appealing, and, like \cite{Dauisius1727}, his suggested emendation neatly sidesteps the lack of direct object by replacing it \textit{adducit} with an intransitive verb.\par
\textit{Venit} is, additionally, far more common in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} than \cite{Dauisius1727} \textit{aduenit}, and is found in finite and infinitive forms twenty times in the text, and in participial forms three further times. Parallels from elsewhere in the text that can be used in support of \cite{Vielhaber1869}’s emendation include 62.1, where the ablative of accompaniment \textit{cum copiis} shares the same function as in this paragraph (\textit{paucis diebus Q. Cassi litteris acceptis rex Bogus cum copiis uenit}), and 25.5, where \textit{uenit} is used with \textit{ad} (\textit{cum ad Canopum uentum esset}).\par
\cite{Vielhaber1869}’s emendation does depend on a two-step error and on the superfluous inclusion of the preposition \textit{ad} with \textit{Pelusium}, an unnecessary word despite the parallel at 25.5. Indeed, \textit{uenit} is used with a designated destination without a linking preposition at 63.1: … \textit{et reliquorum auxiliorum uenit ea mente Vliam ut sine ullo studio contentiones Cassii Marcellique componeret}.\footnote{Despite the “home-Rome” rule regarding the superfluity of prepositions with proper names of cities with accusatives showing direction (see \textit{AG} 427.2), the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} is somewhat inconsistent in this grammatical construction. At 58.1, \textit{adducit} is used with the preposition \textit{ad Cordubam}; at 42.4, \textit{adducit} is used with \textit{in} \textit{Macedoniam}, reflecting the use of a preposition to advancement within a country (\textit{AG} 428c). Similarly, variations and inconsistencies exist within the Caesarian corpus. {\itshape BC} 1.36.4, {\itshape BC} 1.36.5, {\itshape BC} 1.61.5, and {\itshape BC} 3.80.4.2 offer forms of \textit{adduco} with destinations without separate prepositions; {\itshape BG} 1.43.3, {\itshape BG} 2.1.3, and {\itshape BG} 4.18.4, on the other hand, combine forms of \textit{adduco} with an iterated \textit{ad}; whereas {\itshape BG} 4.36.2 and {\itshape BG} 5.46.3 mix the passive infinitive \textit{adduci} with the preposition \textit{in}).} Furthermore, the fact that \textit{aduenio} appears in the Corpus, if only in participial forms, is a deterrent to emending it out of the present passage.\par
c. \cite{Fleischer} proposed \textit{Pelusium} \textit{accedit}, and cited four parallels from the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum} of \textit{accedo} used with an accusative of destination without a preposition: 37.3 \textit{Domitius postero die propius Nicopolin accessit castraque oppido contulit}, 38.1 \textit{propiusque ipse Alexandriam per Syriam accederet}, 56.6 \textit{ipse classem quam parabat ut inspiceret, Hispalim accedit ibique moratur}, 67.1 \textit{cum propius Pontum finesque Gallograeciae accessisset}. Though the number of parallels seems impressive, \cite{Fleischer} himself notes that three of his examples include the adverb \textit{propius}, while paragraph 26 does not.\par
d. A more radical repair to the verb that attempted to emend the problems of tense and syntax was proposed by \cite{Hoffmann1890}, who altered \textit{adducit} to \textit{adductis} and excised \textit{cum}, resulting in the following:

\begin{quote}Sub idem tempus Mithridates Pergamenus … missus in Syriam Ciliciamque initio belli Alexandrini ad auxilia arcessenda, magnis copiis, quas celeriter et propensissima civitatum uoluntate et sua diligentia confecerat, itinere pedestri, quo coniungitur Aegyptus Syriae, Pelusium adductis, id oppidum firmo praesidio occupatum Achillae propter opportunitatem loci … in suam redegit potestatem praesidiumque ibi suum collocauit.\end{quote}

\noindent This is, as is made clear from the text above, a three-part emendation: 1. \cite{Hoffmann1890} deleted the \textit{cum} of \textit{cum magnis copiis}, 2. he emended \textit{adducit} to \textit{adductis} (a reasonable transposition), and 3. he deleted the -\textit{que} of \textit{idque}, reducing the number of finite, indicative verbs in this lengthy sentence to two and the number of -\textit{que}’s to one. The distribution of these emendations, which requires a number of small errors to coordinate throughout the passage, makes his suggestion less likely; the great separation between \textit{magnis copiis} and \textit{propugnantibus}, forty-six words apart from one another, is another reason to doubt Hoffmann's emendation. Yet the repair is worth consideration because, although with each intervention his proposal becomes more unlikely, each individual emendation is plausible and his overall approach to altering the verb is of a completely different character from those that preceded him.\par
There are also emendations that resolve the difficult syntax of \textit{adducit} without altering the form of the verb, three of which are discussed below.\par
e. \cite{Vascosanus} replaced \textit{cum magnis copiis} with \textit{magnas copias}; \cite{Stephanus} made the same emendation almost simultaneously. The emendation is based upon the overall sense of the passage: the ablative of accompaniment makes it clear that it is (at least in part) the \textit{copiae} that Mithridates led into Asia, so the deletion of \textit{cum} and modification of the cases of \textit{magnis copiis} simplifies this complex sentence. But this emendation, too, requires a two-step corruption, wherein first the accusatives shifted to ablatives, then \textit{cum} was inserted (or the same steps in reverse order); these changes could have occurred accidentally through transcription (though there is no nearby \textit{cum} that could have resulted in dittography), or the distance between the accusative and its transitive verb could have led a particularly intrusive scribe to alter the text to its detriment. Distance alone, however, was little enough cause to prompt such an innovation, as it is unclear why the ablative of accompaniment would have been inserted in place of the accusative.\par
f. Landgraf in 1891 chose not to alter the paradosis at all, but rather to justify the anomalous use of \textit{adducit} by means of anacoluthon. Landgraf explains the lack of a direct object for \textit{adducit} as an error original to the text resulting from the ungainly length of the sentence, which resulted either in the author’s losing track of the syntax of his sentence or choosing rather to start again with emphasis—a subtle distinction that either demeans the style of the author of the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} or underscores its similarity to other prose works incorporating rhetorical figures. This is an attractive solution, as it requires no alteration of the text at all, and can be used to explain the rambling structure of this sentence with logic rather than by assuming random clumsiness of the author and ignorance of all subsequent scribes and readers. Even with anacoluthon, however, the verb \textit{adducit} strongly desires a direct object, even if only a resumptive deictic hearkening back to the ablative of accompaniment.\par
g. Following upon Landgraf’s supposition of anacoluthon, it is additionally possible, and, indeed, my suggested emendation, that there is a lacuna of one or more words before the verb \textit{adducit} that included its original direct object. The grammatical problem of \textit{adducit} is subtle enough that no subsequent scribe would necessarily suspect a lost direct object, or indeed look for or supply a correction. The sheer length of the sentence is a likely cause for such an omission: \textit{adducit} occurs only at the conclusion of the long opening sentence; a lacuna may indeed have arisen precisely because of the string of genitives, participial phrases, and relative clauses that in the end masks the syntactic trouble with \textit{adducit}.\par
It is possible that the lacuna included a number of troops, or a military unit such as a legion (cf. the list of troops provided at {\itshape BC} 3.4.3–6). Mithridates, although a Pergamene, may have led legions alongside the \textit{copiae} he had rallied together; something similar occurs at 62.1 (\textit{rex Bogus cum copiis uenit adiungitque ei legioni quam secum adduxerat conplures cohortes auxiliarias Hispanorum}). Likewise, commonly abbreviated words, such as \textit{nostros} or deictics such as \textit{eas}, could easily have been lost. A lacuna doesn’t fix everything, of course, since anacoluthon is still present.\par
3. The third problem in this passage is the word \textit{Achillae}, which, in form, could be either a genitive or a dative, and is problematic both in syntax and in its position within the sentence. There are two possible grammatical functions served by this word: either it is a dative of agency with the perfect passive participle \textit{occupatum} (uncommon and therefore unlikely), or it is a possessive genitive depending on \textit{praesidio}. The latter is a more likely reading, but the intervening word \textit{occupatum} makes for an awkward word order.\par
The name Achillas only occurs two other times in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, and here the word serves only to remind the reader of the identity of the stronghold’s leader. Achillas himself plays no direct role in the action of the passage. The possibility must therefore be entertained that \textit{Achillae} was supplied by a scribe as a gloss on the text. We therefore suggest excision as a possible repair.\par
4. The final problem involves the unusual phrase \textit{multiplici praesidio}. As with \textit{adducit} above, the issue is not one of confusion within the manuscripts, for \textit{multiplici praesidio} is undisputedly the parodosis. Suspicion arises, however, because of the seeming tautology that arises if \textit{propugnantibus} is construed with \textit{copiis} as a drawn-out ablative absolute with a repetitive phrase contained within it. The phrase \textit{multiplici praesidio} complicates the surrounding ablative phrase without, at first glance, contributing additional information about the fighting—we have already been informed by \textit{magnis … copiis} that there are a large number of troops fighting. So, if we read \textit{copiis} as the noun of the ablative absolute in agreement with \textit{propugnantibus}, \textit{multiplici praesidio}, whether understood in apposition or as a locative ablative, is superfluous—or, at the very least, the term \textit{multiplici} is. At {\itshape BC} 1.69.4 one finds the ablative \textit{praesidio} used as a locative within an ablative absolute (… \textit{atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt}), but \textit{multiplex} occurs nowhere else in the Caesarian corpus. \cite{Gemoll} therefore proposed that \textit{multiplici praesidio} should be removed, arguing that it was inserted into the text as a gloss. \cite{Gemoll} is correct in positing that \textit{multiplici praesidio} provides little additional information: yet the fact that the phrase supplies no necessary data can also be used to rebut the probability of this phrase acting as a gloss in the first place. Glosses are meant to provide helpful information to a reader, not repeat what is already stated in a synonymous phrase; thus no scholarly scribe would find the need or desire to add it in the first place.\par
But Landgraf (1888) defended the parodosis, retaining the phrase \textit{multiplici praesidio} but construing it, not as a parallel or subordinate detail to \textit{magnis copiis}, but rather as the noun paired with the participle \textit{propugnantibus} in the ablative absolute. \cite{Landgraf1888} cited Liu. 32.32.4 as a parallel for \textit{praesidium} used as a collective singular (\textit{arcem regium tenebat praesidium neque ut decederent inde aut Opuntiorum minui aut auctoritate imperatoris Romani perpelli potuerunt}). Not only can \textit{praesidium} function collectively, but \textit{multiplex}, too, may do so, and one can complement Landgraf’s defense with parallels elsewhere in Latin (see {\itshape TLL} 8.1592.48–60 ‘spectat ad quantitatem,’ where this passage is listed along with fourteen others).\par
This interpretation resolves the matter, too, of the meaning of \textit{propugnantibus}, a \textit{defensive} verb that generally means “to make a sortie” or “to go out to fight,” often explicitly from walls or battlements. This is an action that befits the troops of Achillas but not those of Mithridates, who are storming a well guarded city, and thus we should not expect the \textit{copiae} (who belong to Mithridates) to be the subject of \textit{propugnantibus}. The meaning of the participle, therefore, makes the ablative absolute extending from \textit{magnis} to \textit{propugnantibus} unlikely, and favors instead Landgraf’s explanation of the paradosis. Inserted in a sentence about the operations of Mithridates’ troops, \textit{multiplici praesidio pertinaciter propugnantibus} reminds the careful reader of both sides of the battle and should be understood as an ablative absolute with adversative force.\par
Furthermore, although \textit{multiplex} is not found elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus, the word itself is not uncommon word in classical Latin,\footnote{A {\itshape Brepolis} search, for example, offers over nine hundred forms of the adjective from authors predating 500 CE, nearly two hundred of which belong to the classical period.} and is found frequently in historical works by authors such as Sallust and Livy, as well as in the philosophical works of Cicero. The term should not, therefore, be omitted on stylistic grounds. It even echoes nicely the previous description of Achillas’ \textit{praesidium} at the opening of the sentence, where it is characterized as being “\textit{firmus},” and the lengthy description at {\itshape BC} 3.110.1–6. \textit{Multiplici,} then, is a lynchpin that identifies the \textit{praesidium} as that of the enemy, marks the opening of the concessive ablative absolute, and emphasizes the success of Mithridates in this passage.

\noindent The ungainly sentence presented by the paradosis here accumulated substantive innovations in the process of transmission and has accordingly been the object of a variety of interventions. As a first step towards establishing a text it will be important to state the textual evidence clearly, since, as will soon become clear, most editors have resorted to excision and consequently shown little interest in the problems raised by the excised text.\par
As transmitted in {\itshape MUTV} the sentence contains a string of five ablative constructions, whereas in {\itshape S} there are only three since the phrase \textit{constantiaque uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia} has been omitted. Another singular variant occurs in {\itshape V}, where the first ablative expression is bracketed between the connecting relative and the subject: \textit{Quorum impetum magna cum prudentia Mithridates constantiaque} etc. Finally, the noun in this first ablative expression, \textit{prudentia}, is transmitted in {\itshape ST} alongside a variant, \textit{potentia}, that must go back at least to their common source, {\itshape nu}, or perhaps all the way to the archetype.\footnote{On variants in the archetype see Damon 2015b, 58–59. They are usually visible in the {\itshape mu} family, not, as here, in descendants of {\itshape nu}.}\par
The version of the sentence found in {\itshape S} appears in editions from the {\itshape editio princeps} onwards (the only early exception is the edition of \cite{Beroaldus}, who prints the paradosis). That is, it made its way into the vulgate long before {\itshape S} itself was used in the constitution of the text, via {\itshape N}, a descendant of {\itshape S}; \cite{Brown} (1972, 48–49) describes the source of the {\itshape editio princeps} as a manuscript that contains “a text based on a union of M and N … that was the basis of succeeding editions for nearly four hundred years.” So although the phrase \textit{constantiaque uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia} has been confronting texts that exclude it since the first time the readings of {\itshape M} and {\itshape N} were joined in a single manuscript, only \cite{Beroaldus} (1504) admitted it into the text. Nobody wants it. The long string of ablatives is clumsy, and the juxtaposition of moral terms such as \textit{prudentia}, \textit{constantia}, and \textit{imprudentia} with the matter-of-fact \textit{consuetudine nostra castris uallatis} is jarring.\par
Yet signs of disquiet percolate. Two of the variants mentioned above may originate in purposeful innovations. The transposition in {\itshape V} detaches the moralizing ablatives from \textit{uallatis} and applies them to the main clause, where they make better sense: \textit{Quorum impetum magna cum prudentia Mithridates constantiaque uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia … sustinuit} (cf. {\itshape BG} 7.10.3 \textit{impetum magno animo sustineant}).\footnote{The frequently occurring expression \textit{impetum sustinere} is accompanied by a variety of modifiers in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, but the {\itshape BG} passage quoted above is the only other example with a modal ablative, unless {\itshape BAlex} 8.4 \textit{Magno negotio impetus hostium aduersos ex munitionibus sustineri} counts as one.} Of course {\itshape V} has a habit of transposing words and phrases, and the resulting word order does not always make sense, so one cannot be sure that the transposition here is deliberate; it may have originated in an eye-skip from m- to m-.\footnote{On transpositions in {\itshape V} see \cite{Damon2015b}, 93 with note 183.} The presence of \textit{potentia} is harder to explain. In a phrase that modifies \textit{uallatis} it works even less well than \textit{prudentia} does, and it works no better with \textit{uirtutum}. Furthermore, it spoils the \textit{prudentia/imprudentia} antithesis. Why is it here? My best guess is that the innovation intended here was \textit{impotentia} in place of \textit{imprudentia}, and that \textit{potentia} attached itself to the wrong \textit{prudentia}. \textit{Alexandrinorum impotentia} would then refer back to the greedy haste of the Alexandrian troops in the preceding sentence (27.4 \textit{Quae primae copiae flumen a Delta transire et Mithridati occurrere potuerunt proelium commiserunt festinantes praeripere subsequentibus uictoriae societatem}) and prepare the way for \textit{incaute} and \textit{insolenter} in the following one.\footnote{These troops later remedy their tactical error and join the troops coming up from behind (27.7).} The word \textit{impotentia} is not Caesarian, but that is not an obstacle to seeing it as an innovation; it is applied to the behavior of (former) soldiers at Tac. {\itshape Ann}. 14.31.3 \textit{impotentiam ueteranorum}.\footnote{The related adverb is used at {\itshape BAlex} 33.2 \textit{regnasse impotenter Ganymeden docuimus}.}\par
Early editors were aware of other manuscript variants. \cite{Vascosanus} notes in his margin that the phrase missing in {\itshape S} and the vulgate is present in “old books” (\textit{in uetustis quibusdam codicibus}). Davies, too, reports the phrase as a manuscript variant—and then condemns it as a gloss. He also, however, reports that \cite{Ciacconius} knew of a manuscript containing a significantly shorter and different version, \textit{constantiaque militum} (cf. Cic. {\itshape Ph}. 3.8 \textit{uirtute … Caesaris constantiaque militum ueteranorum}). This variant shines a spotlight on the awkwardness of \textit{uirtutum} in the supposed gloss. Good (or even adequate) parallels for the plural and abstract genitive are hard to find. At {\itshape BHisp} 17.1 we find the singular \textit{hanc uirtutis constantiam}, at Tac. {\itshape Germ}. 8 the concrete \textit{constantia precum} (it is followed by \textit{obiectu pectorum}). The closest conceptual parallel is probably the Ciceronian expression \textit{constantia totius uitae} ({\itshape Fin}. 3.50, and without \textit{totius} at {\itshape Sull}. 73 and a handful of other spots), but it is not particularly close. When Incertus speaks of Mithridates’ \textit{constantia oppugnandi} in the preceding paragraph the dependent genitive is quite different: 26.2 \textit{perseuerantia constantiaque oppugnandi quo die est aggressus} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{Pelusium}) \textit{in suam redegit potestatem}. It is easy enough to imagine \textit{constantiaque militum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia} (or \textit{impotentia}) as an indignant addition to a passage in which the commander is given all the credit for a military success. But it is quite hard to believe in an innovation that substitutes the problematic \textit{uirtutum} for the satisfactory \textit{militum}. \cite{Oudendorp} resists seeing a gloss here but he too balks at \textit{uirtutum}, proposing \textit{uirium} instead, a collocation for which no good parallel exists. \cite{Madvig} achieves a satisfactory expression by supposing that \textit{uirtutum} originated in \textit{uirtutis tum}, and that the loss of \textit{tum} prompted the addition of \textit{magna} before its correlative \textit{cum} and \textit{et} to supply the necessary connective tissue (\textit{cum prudentia constantiaque uirtutis tum Alexandrinorum imprudentia}), but the string of innovations is implausibly elaborate. \cite{Klotz} queries the relevance (and therefore likelihood) of the beginning of the supposed gloss: “quid in faciendis castris constantiae sit non uideo.”\footnote{\cite{Klotz} tentatively suggests transposing the string to the following sentence, where it can modify \textit{magnum numerum eorum interfecit}. But an innovation that results in the movement of a substantial chunk of authentic text over the seventeen intervening words is hard to credit, and anyway he does not explain what to do with \textit{uirtutum} or how \textit{constantiaque} makes sense when paired with \textit{eruptione undique facta}. On long-distance transpositions proposed for this tradition see \cite{Damon2015b}, 131 with note 5.}\par
It is clear that the tradition’s archetype contained glosses of both the one-or-two word variety\footnote{See, e.g., {\itshape BC} 1.1.1 [\textit{a Fabio}], 1.4.3 [\textit{adulatio}], 3.2.2 [\textit{inopia nauium}], 3.11.1 [\textit{Corcyrae}], 3.101.4 [\textit{circiter XL}].} and longer phrases, which are generally self-contained units.\footnote{See, e.g., {\itshape BC} 1.7.2 [\textit{quae superioribus annis armis esset restituta}] 2.4.4 [\textit{uehementiusque exterreamur}], 3.11.1 [\textit{antequam de mandatis agi inciperet}], 3.48.1 [\textit{Id ad similitudinem panis efficiebant}.], 3.101.4 [\textit{pari atque eadem ratione egerunt}], 3.112.12 [\textit{nutricius pueri et procurator regni, in parte Caesaris}], 3.112.12 [\textit{Haec initia belli Alexandrini fuerunt}.]. See also on 7.2 above for a possible gloss in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}. For further details, see \cite{Damon2015b}, 59–60.} One might defend printing the text of {\itshape S} by saying that the string \textit{constantiaque … imprudentia} was a gloss in the archetype and that {\itshape S} transmits the text of the archetype but not the gloss.\footnote{\cite{Klotz} and \cite{Andrieu}, who accept the {\itshape S} vs. {\itshape beta} stemma, relegate \textit{constantiaque … imprudentia} to the apparatus and signal no omission in the text itself, which suggests that they think the string arose in {\itshape beta}, not the archetype. On this reasoning see \cite{Damon2015b}, 18 note 48 and 23–29.} However, in none of the other long glosses in this tradition does {\itshape S} lack the string that editors excise.\footnote{The closest parallel is found at {\itshape BC} 1.82.1, where {\itshape S} omits two non-adjacent words from a passage where editors make more wholesale excisions.} Alternatively, it is possible to follow \cite{Landgraf1891b} (1891b, 9) in explaining the text of {\itshape S} as the result of an eye-skip from \textit{prudentia} to \textit{imprudentia}. This would be one of many such omissions, perhaps engendered by the simultaneous substitution of \textit{prudentia} for \textit{potentia}.\footnote{See, e.g., {\itshape BC} 1.6.3, tota … refertur \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (17 words omitted after a preceding \textit{refertur}); 1.40.5 5 cuius … legionibus \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (7 words omitted after a preceding \textit{legionibus}); 1.74.4 interim … adducunt \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (8 words omitted after a preceding \textit{mittunt}); 3.13.2 simul … incidit \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (8 words omitted after a preceding \textit{contendit}); 3.60.5 cum … \textit{61.1} erant \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (11 words omitted after a preceding \textit{transierunt}), {\itshape BAlex} 2.1 magnumque … adduxerant \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (12 words omitted after a preceding \textit{miserant}), 15.8 atque … exposceret \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (16 words omitted after a preceding \textit{peteret}), 17.5 constiterunt … litore \textit{om.} {\itshape S} (12 words omitted after a preceding litore). For another omission by {\itshape S} in a passage involving archetypal variants see {\itshape BC} 1.6.2.} So it seems worth taking another look at this supposed gloss.\par
The phrase \textit{constantia uirtutum} is both unusual per se and hard to square with the context: what virtues are we supposed to see here?\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} dubs \textit{constantiaque … imprudentia} “un énoncé énigmatique” (1954, LXVII).} We have one in \textit{prudentia}, obviously, but for others we have to reach back to 26.2, \textit{perseuerantia constantiaque}, where it is disconcerting to find \textit{constantia} itself as one of Mithridates’s virtues, or 26.1 {\itshape magnae nobilitatis domi scientiaeque in bello et uirtutis fidei dignitatisque in amicitia Caesaris}, where \textit{uirtus} is one of his qualities. It is hard to believe that the gloss began with this problematic phrase—the addition of \textit{-que} would have occurred when the gloss moved into the text—so it is perhaps worth considering whether the gloss started earlier, with the first of the ablatives in this string: \textit{magna cum prudentia}. If the original gloss was in the nominative (\textit{magna prudentia constantiaque uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia}) it would resemble others in this tradition,\footnote{One might compare the two-part gloss preserved in \textit{m} at {\itshape BC} 1.28.2 after \textit{iubet}: \textit{caesar castrum subit. pompeius ultra mare fugit}. Moral-commentary glosses can be found in {\itshape U}, e.g. on 63v \textit{misericordia in uictore praestantissima}, on 65v \textit{commune uitium} (see Damon 2015a, xliv).} and \textit{cum} could have been added when the phrase was integrated into the text.\footnote{This emendation was proposed by Dallas Simons in LATN 540, spring 2015.} This hypothetical gloss maps acceptably onto the text, in which the praise of Mithridates in the present sentence is followed by criticism of the Alexandrians in the next: \textit{Cum uero \uline{incaute atque insolenter succedere eos} munitionibus uideret eruptione undique facta magnum numerum eorum interfecit.} On the other hand, \textit{magna} seems oddly fulsome for a gloss.\par
A different solution was suggested tentatively by \cite{Dübner} and embraced by \cite{Landgraf1891b}, who suggested that \textit{constantiaque} belonged in the text and the rest arose from a marginal gloss of the following form: \textit{uirtutes Mithridatis}. \textit{Alexandrinorum imprudentia}, a shorter form of the gloss discussed above. \cite{Dübner}’s solution supplies a possible origin for the problematic \textit{uirtutum}, which started life as a nominative plural referring to \textit{prudentia constantiaque} and was converted into a genitive when it was moved into the text. \cite{Klotz}' point about the apparent irrelevance of \textit{constantia} remains, but the pair \textit{prudentia constantiaque} can perhaps be explained by the antithesis with the following \textit{incaute atque insolenter}, itself an unusual collocation in the corpus.\par
In general, the presumption of a gloss here is strengthened by the presence of another string of suspect words involving criticism of Alexandrians at {\itshape BAlex} 7.2. On the other hand, Incertus does have a reason to “talk up” Mithridates’ virtues here, in that this loyal royal ally will receive a kingdom as a reward from Caesar later in the work, in a passage that refers the reader back to chapters 26–27: 78.2 \textit{Mithridaten Pergamenum, \supplied{a} quo rem feliciter celeriterque gestam in Aegypto \uline{supra} scripsimus, regio genere ortum, disciplinis etiam regiis educatum … regem Bosphori constituit}.\footnote{Furthermore, Mithridates’ claims on Caesar seem to have been a matter of dispute. Incertus’ account of Mithridates’ march to Alexandria differs substantially from the two accounts by Josephus ({\itshape BJ} 1.187–92, {\itshape AJ} 14.127–39), who provides many more details and credits Antipater, not Mithridates, with the decisive actions. Josephus cites Asinius Pollio and Strabo ({\itshape AJ} 14.138–39) and mentions none of Mithridates’ qualities. Dio’s account (42.41–43), too, has different details but keeps Mithridates in the spotlight.} He introduces the paragraphs on Mithridates’ \textit{res gestae} with a catalogue of qualities (26.1 \textit{magnae nobilitatis domi scientiaeque in bello et uirtutis fidei dignitatisque in amicitia Caesaris}) and works his virtues into the narrative itself (26.2 \textit{perseuerantia constantiaque oppugnandi}, 27.5 \textit{prudentia} and possibly \textit{constantia}). \textit{Constantiaque} in our passage could certainly be a carryover from 26.2, but in favor of its authenticity are both the antithesis with \textit{incaute atque insolenter} and Incertus’ penchant for pairing such abstract nouns (11.3 \textit{scientia et uirtute}, 15.1 \textit{scientiam atque animi magnitudinem} (similarly at 31.1), 16.5 \textit{sollertia atque ars}, 42.2 \textit{prudentia ac diligentia}, 43.1 \textit{uirtute et scientia}, 48.3 \textit{disciplinam seueritatemque} (similarly 65.1), 51.4 \textit{labor aut uigilantia}, 55.2 \textit{dignitatis et gratiae}, 65.1 \textit{ambitione atque indiligentia}, 68.1 \textit{prudentiae ac diligentiae}, 68.1 \textit{hospitio atque amicitiae}).\footnote{On such pairings in the {\itshape BAlex} see recently Gaertner/Hausburg (2013, 37 with nn. 34, 37).}\par
On balance it seems that \cite{Dübner}’s emendation best accounts for the features of this problematic passage, particularly the origin of \textit{uirtutum}. The string of ablatives is still awkward, but there is a comparable collection in the preceding paragraph (25.2 \textit{magnis circumdatum copiis multiplici praesidio pertinaciter propugnantibus et copiarum magnitudine … et perseuerantia constantiaque oppugnandi quo die est aggressus}). The somewhat irrelevant praise of Mithridates can be ascribed to political exigency, and the fact that {\itshape S} makes one of its characteristic eye-skips here is coincidental.

\endgroup

\noindent The problem here lies in the change of subject at \textit{primi tamen}, which leaves the implicit subject in the first part of the result clause, presumably \textit{nostri}, without a verb. \cite{Kübler1896a} accordingly posited a lacuna before \textit{primi} and suggested filling it with \textit{impetus fieret}; the expression is paralleled at {\itshape BG} 1.22.3: \textit{ut undique uno tempore in hostes impetus fieret}. \cite{Klotz} prints this in preference to \cite{Schneider}’s subsequent suggestion \textit{inrumperent}, imperfectly paralleled at {\itshape BG} 4.14.3 \textit{quorum timor cum … significaretur, milites nostri … incitati in castra inruperunt. Inrumperentur} improves on \textit{impetus fieret} by supplying a subject that can stand more easily in antithesis with \textit{primi tamen}, but even \cite{Schneider} claims no more for this repair than that it suits the sense of the passage (“Hinter \textit{partibus} fehlt ein Verbum von der Bedeutung ‘vorstürmen’ oder ‘einbrechen’; das von mir eingesetzte \textit{inrumperent} genügt dem Sinne nach.”). \cite{Andrieu} leaves an unfilled lacuna in his text but supplies \supplied{l’assaut se produisait} in the translation.\par
Yet there is no palaeographical motivation for an omission here. Furthermore, these supplements leave the logic of \textit{tamen} unsatisfactory: they require an antithesis between “everyone attacking simultaneously” and “the first group capturing” (\textit{primi tamen caperent}) that is not intuitively obvious.\footnote{The antithesis between \textit{rex} and \textit{Caesar} in a similar construction at 28.2 is much clearer because it hinges on the relative expeditiousness of their respective routes: \textit{celeriore fluminis Nili nauigatione rex est usus …. Caesar … circumuectus eo mari quod Africae partis esse dicitur, sicuti supra demonstrauimus, \uline{prius tamen} regis copiis occurrit quam is Mithridaten aggredi posset}.} So either the lacuna is longer than has yet been suspected or a different solution should be sought.\par
Rather than accept an imperfect or incomplete repair, we print the text as it stands, as an {\itshape apo koinou} construction in a moment of narrative excitement. According to Leumann/Hoffmann/Szantyr this construction, while occasionally attested in prose, “bei Caes(ar) ganz fehlt” (LHS 2.834; the anonymous authors of the \textit{corpus Caesarianum} are not mentioned).\footnote{However, they do (2.444) cite a Caesarian example of an {\itshape apo koinou} modifier ({\itshape BG} 4.24.4 \textit{non eadem alacritate ac studio}); this is obviously much simpler than our passage.} However, it is also the sort of figure of speech that would be emended out of editions of Caesar and his followers, as it has been here, since it has been taken to be (or simulate) a feature of colloquial language (ibid.). \footnote{On textual disputes over {\itshape apo koinou} \textit{neque} see LHS 2.517; the topic is discussed at length in \cite{Baehrens1912} (1912) passim, with Caesarian examples on 266–67 and 300 and passages of comparable complexity to ours on 280–81. On the \textit{figura} as a device used in pursuit of the “Gesetz der wachsende Glieder” see LHS 2.724.} Other stylistic features of the clause, including the omission of the subject and the predicate use of \textit{primus}, are in fact characteristic of this text. \footnote{See \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} (2013) 36 nn. 31–32.} For the collocation \textit{ex omnibus partibus loca capere} cf. Hirt. 8.36.4 \textit{repente omnibus ex partibus … loca superiora capiuntur}. Taking \textit{caperent} as the verb for both halves of the result clause sharpens the antithesis (\textit{eodem tempore} vs. \textit{primi}), and \textit{tamen} introduces a correction to an overstatement, as it often does, for example at 18.4 \textit{perterriti … ad oppidum enatauerunt. Multi \uline{tamen} ex his capti interfectique sunt} (cf. Hirt. 8.8.3 \textit{omnium impedimentorum agmen, quod \uline{tamen} erat mediocre}). \footnote{On the relatively high frequency of \textit{tamen} in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum}, particularly in chapters 22–78, see \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} (2013) 67 n.184 (the numbers in their Appendix K, p. 288, are mistaken).}

\noindent In chapters 34–35 Domitius orders Pharnaces to withdraw from Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia, which had been the kingdoms of Deiotarus and Ariobarzanes, Roman allies. Pharnaces withdraws from Cappadocia but not from Lesser Armenia. Consequently, Domitius marches towards Armenia with troops, traveling W-E along a ridge between Cappadocia (to the south) and Armenia (to the north). Incertus specifies two advantages of this route in a sentence whose syntax is incomplete. The main clause is transmitted as follows:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris has esse certas opportunitates\end{quote}

\noindent This is printed in many editions, including those of \cite{Scaliger} and \cite{Nipperdey}, presumably on the assumption that a \textit{uerbum noscendi} could be understood from \textit{instituit} two sentences earlier. But it is not obvious that \textit{iter facere instituit} will launch a train of thought, and if it does, the thought is immediately interrupted by an eighteen-word topographical parenthesis (\textit{Nam … Armenia}).\par
In some \textit{recentiores} and the \textit{editio princeps} the sentence is rewritten thus:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris hae erant certae opportunitates \textit{ϛ}\end{quote}

\noindent A less drastic repair is to supply a finite verb to govern the indirect statement, e.g.:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris has esse certas opportunitates \supplied{uidit} {\itshape \cite{Forchhammer}} (1852, 84)\end{quote}


\begin{quote}cuius itineris has esse certas opportunitates \supplied{cognouerat} {\itshape \cite{Klotz}} (1927, ad loc.)\end{quote}


\begin{quote}cuius itineris has esse cernebat opportunitates {\itshape \cite{Vielhaber1869}} (1869, 570)\footnote{Although \textit{cernere} usually denotes visual perception rather than realization in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, it does govern indirect statement at {\itshape BC} 3.69.4 \textit{cum … Pompeium adesse … cernerent}. For \cite{Vielhaber1869}’s argument see  note \ref{stba-35.3-note-3}.}\end{quote}

\noindent But the absence of a main verb is not the only problem here. The adjective \textit{certas} has been suspected; indeed \cite{Scaliger} excised it, presumably on stylistic grounds, since it does not affect the syntax.\footnote{Cf. \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, 570) “Aehnlich ist vielleicht … in den wenig passenden \textit{certas} das Verb \textit{cernebat} vesteckt,” and \cite{Larsen} (1886, 18): “Verum non modo infinitivus non ferri potest sed etiam ‘certas’, sub quo sine dubio error aliquis latet.”\label{stba-35.3-note-3}} In our view none of these solutions is satifactory, not even the solution adopted in the most recent editions, \cite{Klotz} \supplied{\textit{cognouerat}}. Indirect statement, whether by implication or emendation, creates a problem here: the deictic \textit{has}, which is the subject of the indirect statement, points to the following \textit{quod} clauses, but the indicative verbs in those clauses set them outside of the indirect statement. So either the deictic \footnote{The deictic \textit{his} in the second \textit{quod} clause works normally, referring to the terrain under discussion in the narrative.} or the mood\footnote{Cf. 70.2 \textit{monuit … ne … nimis eo gloriarentur beneficio quod auxilio Pompeio non misissent}, where \textit{eo} points forward to the substantive clause \textit{quod … non misissent}, and similarly 16.3 \textit{Haec … Caesar suis exposuerat ut hoc maiore animo contenderent quod omnium salutem sibi commendatam uiderent}, where \textit{hoc} in the purpose clause points forward to the substantive clause \textit{quod … uiderent}. Possibly also 24.6 \textit{hoc … quod}, although the \textit{quod} clause here may be causal.} is wrong.\par
\cite{Larsen} (1886, 18–19) proposed a different construction:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris has est secutus opportunitates\end{quote}

\noindent In support of his emendation he cited {\itshape BC} 1.1.3 \textit{sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur} as a parallel for the abstract object of \textit{sequor} and Cic. {\itshape Off}. 1.35 \textit{sed credo aliquid secutor, opportunitatem loci maxime} for the pursuit of opportunity. By replacing \textit{esse certas} with \textit{est secutus} \cite{Larsen} also addressed the problem of \textit{certas}. However, \cite{Larsen}’s paleographical argument (-\textit{us} misread as -\textit{as}) is rather weak.\par
\cite{Landgraf1891b} (1891b, 12–13) developed \cite{Larsen}’s emendation in two ways:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris duas est consecutus opportunitates \end{quote}

\noindent For the main verb he substituted one better paralleled in the {\itshape corpus Caesarianum}, and he changed \textit{has} to \textit{duas}, citing in support {\itshape BC} 1.39.4: \textit{Quo facto duas res consecutus est}, a particularly apt parallel since it too is followed by two indicative \textit{quod} clauses.\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} 2002 [1954] ad loc. incorrectly reports Landgraf’s proposal as \textit{has est consecutus} \textit{opportunitates}.}\par
But \textit{certas} does not seem indefensible. The adjective is fairly common in the {\itshape corpus Caesarianum}, occuring more than forty times even outside the formulas \textit{certior fio} and \textit{certum est}. It modifies a wide range of nouns: winds, places, routes, people, military units, news, days, quantities, times, military formations, etc. It modifies hoped-for advantages at {\itshape BC} 3.110.4 \textit{fugitiuis omnibus nostris certus erat Alexandriae receptus certaque uitae condicio}, where \textit{receptus} and \textit{uitae condicio} are as abstract as \textit{opportunitates}.\footnote{Cf. {\itshape BG} 7.37.3 \textit{certissimam Galliae uictoriam}. Similarly future-oriented abstractions appear in negative formulations such as {\itshape BG} 5.29.5 {\itshape quis hoc sibi persuaderet sine certa spe Ambiorigem ad eius modi consilium descendisse}, and Hirt. 8.32.1 \textit{nec se sine certa pernicie … putarent prouinciae fines intrare posse}.} \cite{Scaliger} might object that \textit{certa opportunitas} is not quite the right expression for the first “advantage” mentioned in our passage, namely, the impossibility of a surprise attack on higher ground (\textit{quod in locis superioribus nullus impetus repentinus accidere hostium}\footnote{In the apparatus we suggest the excision of \textit{hostium} as a gloss. Elsewhere in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} and everywhere in the corpus subjective genitives are adjacent to \textit{impetus}, either after it (8.4 \textit{impetus hostium}, 17.4 \textit{impetus nostrorum}, 44.3 \textit{impetum Octauii}) or before it (27.5 and 29.5 \textit{quorum impetum}, 40.3 \textit{uincentium impetum}). It seems superfluous here, and this part of the sentence needs nothing else.} \textit{poterat}): such an attack might be unlikely, but would one guarantee with \textit{certas} that it was impossible? However, it seems unlikely that \textit{certas} arose here by scribal innovation, whether from \textit{secutus} or \textit{consecutus}.\par
There is also no reason emend \textit{esse}, apart from the above-mentioned difficulty caused by the indirect statement. So we preferred a different approach, supplying a verb that can govern the accusative adjective and the infinitive without creating the expectation that the \textit{quod} clauses pointed to by \textit{has} should have subjunctive verbs. Like one of the manuscripts cited by \cite{Oudendorp} (1737, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101066876309?urlappend=\%3Bseq=308}{810–811} n. 3\footnote{\cite{Dübner} (1867, 1.\xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112023932616?urlappend=\%3Bseq=31}{xxi}) calls it the \textit{Bongarsianus tertius}; \cite{Brown} was not able to identify it (1972, 5 n. 1).} ), we supply \supplied{\textit{constat}}:

\begin{quote}cuius itineris has esse certas \supplied{constat} opportunitates\end{quote}

\noindent With \textit{constat} the point of view is in the narrative present, which suits both \textit{has} and the indicative verbs in the substantive clauses.\footnote{Caesar uses both \textit{constat} ({\itshape BG} 6.25.5) and \textit{constabat} (11x) with indirect statement, Incertus and Hirtius only the present form (31.6, Hirt. 8 pr. 4). All three authors also use \textit{constare} in the subjunctive and with other constructions, but these passages provide no help for ours. In our passage \textit{constabat} might also work, to judge by the (imperfect) parallel at {\itshape BG} 7.43.3, with its parenthetical \textit{quod} clause: \textit{constabat inter omnes}—\textit{quod iam ipse Caesar … cognouerat}—\textit{dorsum esse eius iugi prope aequum}.} According to \xref{Dübner}{Dübner} (1867, ad loc.) the scribe supplied it after \textit{opportunitates}, i.e., at the end of its clause. We prefer to place it after \textit{certas,} i.e., between an adjective and the noun it modifies. This unusual word order, which is well attested in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum},\footnote{Cf., e.g., 17.1 \textit{in suam redigeret potestatem}, 37.4 \textit{triniis firmabantur subsidiis}, 37.4 \textit{media collocabantur acie}, 38.3 \textit{suam non producere aciem}, 48.3 \textit{speciosum reddebant … amorem}, 52.1 \textit{quintam fore in Hispania legionem}, 52.3 \textit{proximum gladio traicit lictorem}, 52.4 \textit{leuibus sauciat plagis}, 58.1 \textit{potentem opponeret dignitatem}, 61.6 \textit{necessarium consumeret frumentum}. On hyperbaton as a feature of Incertus’ style see Gaertner and Hausburg 2013, 36–38 with bibliography.} permits a slightly better (but admittedly weak) palaeographical argument: omission of a word starting with \textit{c} (or perhaps with an abbreviation for \textit{con}-) after another word starting with \textit{c}.\footnote{We also considered the possiblity of adding the verb after \textit{cuius itineris}, since in two of its three occurrences in the corpus \textit{constat} begins its sentence (31.6, Hirt. 8 pr. 4), and a position after the connecting relative is a close as it can get to the beginning here.} In any case, the supplement \supplied{\textit{constat}}, which is not even mentioned in recent editions, seems to us worth considering.

\noindent In paragraph 36 Domitius is imagined by Pharnaces as marching from his camp to Nicopolis, seven miles away, through a pass between mountains. Pharnaces set some of his troops in an ambush and ordered livestock and locals to be visible within the pass in order to lure Domitius into the trap. The king’s plan seems designed to accommodate either a friendly or a hostile approach by Domitius, who has issued an ultimatum: Pharnaces must withdraw from Lesser Armenia (34.2, 35.2). Pharnaces, for his part, is still hoping for a negotiated solution, especially one that can be deferred (35.1–2, 36.1, 37.1). In the text of 36.5 as transmitted\footnote{The vulgate text as represented by the \textit{editio princeps} is unusually far from the text of the archetype, especially in the stretch \textit{tamquam … ut in}, where it reads \textit{tanquam amicorum aduentu greges. Sin uero ut in}.\label{stba-36.5-note-2}}—36.4 is simply given as context here—both possibilities are mentioned twice, the friendly approach with \textit{siue amicus} and \textit{tamquam amicorum aduentus}, the hostile approach with \textit{siue inimicus} and \textit{ut in hostium fines}:

\begin{quote}ut siue amicus siue inimicus Domitius eas angustias transiret nihil de insidiis suspicaretur cum in agris et pecora et homines animaduerteret uersari tamquam amicorum aduentus ut in hostium fines ueniret praeda diripienda milites dissiparentur dispersique caederentur\end{quote}

\noindent The sense is fine up to \textit{suspicaretur}, and even up to \textit{aduentus} provided that one supplies \textit{esset} to complete the syntax of the \textit{tamquam} clause. But thereafter things become murky. What kind of \textit{ut} clause comes next? How are \textit{dissiparentur} and \textit{caederentur} connected to the rest of the sentence? And why is \textit{ut in hostium fines} so far from \textit{siue inimicus}?\par
The friend/enemy antithesis and the \textit{siue … siue} pair have suggested various approaches to repairing the text.\par
Taking his lead from a reading found in the \textit{editio princeps}, \cite{Aldus} excised \textit{siue inimicus} and replaced the adjacent \textit{siue … siue} pair with a more distant \textit{si … sin uero} pair:

\begin{quote}ut si\surplus{ue} amicus \surplus{siue inimicus} Domitius eas angustias transiret, nihil de insidiis suspicaretur, cum in agris, et pecora, et homines animaduerteret uersari, tamquam amicorum aduentu, s\supplied{in uero}, ut in hostium fines ueniret, praeda diripienda milites dissiparentur, dispersique caederentur.\footnote{Square and pointed brackets are supplied here and below for the sake of clarity. Aldus also omitted the word greges that appeared in the editio princeps (see the previous note, \ref{stba-36.5-note-2}).}\end{quote}

\noindent He thereby clustered the two references to friendly behavior and the two references to hostile behavior, and simplied the syntax of \textit{tamquam} with \textit{aduentu} as a circumstantial ablative. The resulting sense is good but the repair requires at least three innovations, whose sequence is hard to understand. Did \textit{si amicus} generate \textit{siue inimicus}, which then generated \textit{siue} in place of \textit{si}? Did \textit{uero} fall out before \textit{ut}, and \textit{aduentu} acquire a final \textit{s}, whereupon the orphaned \textit{in} was excised as nonsensical?\par
The difficulty of tracing a path from the original text to what is found in the manuscripts prompted \cite{Nipperdey} (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=203}{195}) to try a different approach. He transposed \textit{siue inimicus} to later in the sentence, simultaneously changing the syntax of \textit{aduentus} by dissolving its final \textit{s} into the transposed phrase:

\begin{quote}ut siue amicus \surplus{siue inimicus} Domitius eas angustias transiret, nihil de insidiis suspicaretur, cum in agris et pecora et homines animaduerteret uersari tamquam amicorum aduentu; s\supplied{iue inimicus} ut in hostium fines ueniret, praeda diripienda milites dissiparentur dispersique caederentur.\end{quote}

\noindent With this text the puzzling \textit{ut} introduces an elliptical comparison \textit{ut in hostium fines} parallel to \textit{tamquam amicorum aduentu}. The initial \textit{ut} clause expresses Pharnaces’ double purpose: that the Romans either fail to suspect the presence of the enemy (\textit{ut … nihil … suspicaretur}) or scatter in pursuit of booty and get killed (\textit{ut … dissiparentur dispersique caederentur}). The two-part purpose is supported by parallel \textit{siue} clauses, \textit{siue amicus … transiret} and \textit{siue inimicus … ueniret}, a construction for which Nipperdey cites two Ciceronian parallels ({\itshape Phil}. 14.13, {\itshape Fin}. 1.3). Clarity, it seems, has been restored, and this is the text printed by \cite{Klotz}. But the explanation of how clarity was lost is still complicated: \textit{siue inimicus} was omitted, the omission was noticed, a repair was attempted by writing the omitted words elsewhere on the page, and they were then reincorporated into the text at a plausible but incorrect position following \textit{siue amicus}. The alteration of \textit{aduentu} to \textit{aduentus} in this scenario is poorly motivated: \textit{siue inimicus} seems to have left its initial letter behind and regenerated it during the course of its travels. \cite{Forchhammer} (1852, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101065205849?urlappend=\%3Bseq=98}{92}) adds that \textit{siue inimicus} contributes nothing when placed in front of \textit{ut in hostium fines}; he prefers to see it as a gloss motivated by the simple \textit{siue} that originally preceded \textit{ut in hostium fines}, but his repair is as complicated as \cite{Nipperdey}’s.\par
\cite{Andrieu} adopts a simplified version of the repair proposed by \cite{Aldus}, with \textit{si} in place of \textit{sin uero}.

\begin{quote}ut si\surplus{ue} amicus \surplus{siue inimicus} Domitius eas angustias transiret, nihil de insidiis suspicaretur, cum in agris, et pecora, et homines animaduerteret uersari, tamquam amicorum aduentu, s\supplied{i} ut in hostium fines ueniret, praeda diripienda milites dissiparentur, dispersique caederentur.\end{quote}

\noindent The series of innovations is now clearer: \textit{aduentu} acquired a final \textit{s}, the left-over minim was omitted, and \textit{si amicus} was expanded into \textit{siue amicus siue inimicus} to make up for the loss of the second \textit{si} clause and apply the friend/enemy antithesis for the verb \textit{transiret}; \textit{ut} … \textit{ueniret} would then mean “supposing he came.” But this is still a three-part innovation involving two spots in the text.\par
In our view the apparent parallelisms in this passage have been pressed too hard.\footnote{See, for example, the note in \cite{Dauisius1706} arguing for \textit{si amicus \surplus{siue inimicus} Domitius}: “nam si inimici antea mentionem fecerat noster, nihil opus erat, ut postea adjiceret \textit{sin uero un in hostium fines ueniret}, quibus ex uerbis luce fit clarius ineptum esse illud additamentum.”} As was said above, the text as transmitted makes sense up to \textit{aduentu}(\textit{s}): Pharnaces’ aim is to keep Domitius in ignorance about the ambush.\footnote{The aim expressed at 35.3 \textit{ut … nihil … suspicaretur} is consonant with that expressed at 37.1 \textit{numquam … intermittebat legatos de pace atque amicitia mittere ad Domitium, cum hoc ipso crederet facilius eum decipi posse}, although the \textit{cum} clause in the latter passage could also be used to argue that Pharnaces planned a preemptive attack. However, it seems more likely to reflect the fact that Domitius did learn about the ambush—or so one presumes from the reference to it in our text. See also note \ref{stba-36.5-note-6}.} The text says nothing about any plan for a preemptive attack on Domitius, and Pharnaces later recalls his troops to prevent their being spotted (37.2 \textit{cum uereretur ne cognoscerentur insidiae, suos in castra reuocauit}); their presence seems to have been a precautionary measure that would allow him to respond quickly if there was any overt aggression on Domitius’ part. He may not have expected aggression, since he knew that Domitius’ army had been weakened by the loss of the two legions that were sent to Caesar (34.3, 35.2), and he was actively seeking a negotiated solution (37.1 \textit{numquam … intermittebat legatos de pace atque amicitia mittere ad Domitium}; cf. 37.2 on Domitius’ \textit{spes pacis}), but precautions were not unwarranted.\footnote{As it happened, Domitius’ “hope of peace” kept him in camp for another day (37.2 \textit{spes pacis Domitio in isdem castris morandi attulit causam}), so Pharnaces lost his chance to make a preemptive attack if he did plan one (37.2 \textit{amissa proximi temporis occasione}).\label{stba-36.5-note-6}} On this reading the two parts of this passage are not parallel (“if friend, do X, if enemy, do Y”) but rather sequential (“deceive Domitius, then react to his actions”). Of the two reactions envisaged, doing nothing and responding to aggression, only the second is mentioned in the present passage; the first is given narrative space later (37.2, quoted above). The implicit contrast here between inaction and action is expressed by the text of \cite{Hoffmann1857}:

\begin{quote}ut, siue amicus siue inimicus Domitius eas angustias transiret, nihil de insidiis suspicaretur, quum in agris et pecora et homines animaduerteret uersari tamquam amicorum aduentu; s\supplied{in} ut in hostium fines ueniret, praeda diripienda milites dissiparentur, dispersique caederentur.\end{quote}

\noindent Hoffmann printed the same text in \cite{Hoffmann1890} and argued against Nipperdey’s emendation (why move \textit{siue inimicus} out of the first conditional clause if deceiving Domitius would have been even more important if his arrival was hostile? 1890, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112099806678?urlappend=\%3Bseq=62}{LIV}). The adversative \textit{sin} is used twice elsewhere in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} (24.1, 42.4), the sequence \textit{siue … siue … sin} in Cicero ({\itshape De orat}. 2.292, \textit{Att}. 7.3.2). Hoffmann’s repair implies a two-part innovation (\textit{aduentu} =⟩ \textit{aduentus}, \textit{in} is omitted) but neither stage is \textit{per se} implausible and the fact that they involve the same spot in the text is a distinct advantage over the repairs discussed so far. \cite{Dübner} adopted it, and so do we.

\noindent When Domitius and Pharnaces finally fought, the Romans were decisively defeated. Three of the four legions involved in the battle suffered catastrophic losses, and Domitius retreated to Asia Minor with the veteran Thirty-sixth and a few other survivors (40.4–5). The battle itself must have been chaotic, but Incertus seems to have been aiming for a narrative as clear as Caesar’s usually are. The battle lines are described in some detail (38.3–4, 39.2), then the events on the Roman right (40.1), then those on the left (40.2), then those in the middle of the line (40.2). After the Roman middle collapses, we return to the right wing (40.3) and finish with the “cost-of-battle” assessment (40.4–5). The framework is clear. But problems in the transmitted text prevent us from seeing exactly what happened on the Roman left:

\begin{quote}at Pontica ex altera parte legio cum paulum auersa hostibus cessisset fossam autem circumire acies secundo conata esset ut aperto latere aggrederetur hostem in ipso transitu fossae confixa et oppressa est.\end{quote}

\noindent As \cite{Nipperdey} says (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=205}{197}), “Verba ‘\textit{acies secundo}’ quin corrupta essent, recte nemo dubitavit.” But those two words are not the only problems in this passage. Here is a fuller list:\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] The unqualified reference to an \textit{acies} here is baffling.
\item[2] The adverb \textit{secundo} appears nowhere else in the corpus, and one would expect it to be preceded by \textit{primum} (uel sim.).
\item[3] It is difficult to see which verbs go with which nominative. Word order suggests that \textit{legio} is the subject of \textit{cessisset}, \textit{acies} the subject of the others, but since we learn later that the Pontic legion was almost completely annihilated in this battle (40.4 \textit{Pontica legione paene tota amissa}) it seems likely that \textit{legio} is the subject of \textit{confixa et oppressa est}. However, since it is the \textit{acies}, not the \textit{legio}, that is mentioned in connection with the \textit{fossa}, the relevance of \textit{in ipso transitu} in that scenario is unclear.
\item[4] The term \textit{transitu} is per se a puzzle, since Incertus has described the troop movement as “going around” (\textit{circumire}) not “going across.”
\item[5] The expression \textit{fossam circumire} is not only in conflict with \textit{in transitu} but also hard to reconcile with the battlefield described here, where Pharnaces’ compact battle line is protected on the flanks by 4-foot trenches (38.3–4) and in the rear, as becomes clear from 40.1, by the walls of Nicopolis. How then could one go around the trench to attack the enemy from the rear? (See further below, under B).
\end{enumerate}\par
The context provides some parameters for solutions to these problems.\begin{enumerate}
\item[A] According to 39.2, Domitius’ battle line consists of a right wing (the Thirty-six legion), a left wing (the “Pontic legion,” i.e., the unit newly recruited in Pontus [34.5]), and a \textit{media acies} (two legions contributed to the Roman war effort by the Galatian king Deiotarus [34.4], separated by a narrow gap). Domitius also placed an unspecified number of cohorts in unspecified positions from which they could serve as reinforcements.
\item[B] The phrase \textit{at … ex altera} \textit{parte} sets the narrative of events on the left wing in antithesis to that of events on the right wing, where the attack of the Thirty-sixth proceeded as follows: the legion advanced outside the trench (\textit{extra fossam}) on Pharnaces’ left, reached the city walls (\textit{moenibus oppidi succederet}…), crossed the trench (\textit{fossamque transiret}), and attacked the enemy from the rear (\textit{auersosque hostes adgrederentur}). A battlefield success-story, as Incertus says (40.1 \textit{secundum proelium}).
\item[C] In 40.2 both \textit{auersa} and \textit{secundo} echo words used in 40.1 (see B above).
\end{enumerate}\par
\cite{Lipsius}, according to \cite{Oudendorp}, addressed problems (1) and (2) as follows:

\begin{quote}… fossam autem circumire acies secunda conata esset …\end{quote}

\noindent With \textit{acies secunda} he created an antithesis for \textit{legio}: the legion fled with its back to the enemy (\textit{legio cum … auersa cessisset}), and a different unit, the \textit{acies secunda}, boldly attempted to cross the trench and attack the enemy, as the Thirty-sixth legion had done on the right.\footnote{\cite{Larsen} (1886, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=20}{20}) developed Lipsius’ emendation by (implausibly) addressing problems (4) and (5): \textit{… fossam autem }circu\supplied{itu trans}ire acies\textit{secunda conata esset}.} But Domitius’ legions were not arranged with a second line, so far as we are told, and the only reinforcements we hear about are some unlocalized (for us) cohorts (39.2 \textit{reliquis cohortibus in subsidiis}\footnote{According to the archetype, they were placed in an ambush (\textit{in insidiis} MUS : \textit{insidiis} TV), but this seems unlikely, since Pharnaces chose the battlefield (38.3).} \textit{conlocatis}). The expression seems to be a recollection of the Caesarian \textit{acies triplex} or \textit{duplex} ({\itshape BG} 1.24.2, 1.49.1, 1.51.2, 3.24.1, 4.14.1; {\itshape BC} 1.41.2, 1.64.6, 1.83.1–2, 3.67.4), which often did occasion reference to the \textit{secunda} \textit{acies} (e.g., {\itshape BG} 1.25.7 \textit{prima et secunda acies}, 1.49.2 \textit{primam et secundam aciem}; {\itshape BC} 1.41.5 \textit{et prima et secunda acies}).\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} prints Lipsius’ emendation, translating \textit{acies secunda} as “sa seconde ligne,” i.e., the second line of the Pontic legion.} The only passage in which the \textit{secunda acies} appears without prior reference to the \textit{prima acies} is {\itshape BAfr} 60.2 \textit{in secunda autem acie}, but this phrase is preceded by a lacuna. The best parallel for the scenario we have here is {\itshape BAfr} 59.2, where Scipio places legions \textit{in fronte}, and behind them, some Numidian troops in \textit{subsidiaria acie}; the arrangement of the Alexandrian fleet at {\itshape BAlex} 14.3 is comparable, with 22 ships \textit{in fronte} and the rest as reinforcements \textit{in secundo ordine}. But our passage has no equivalent for \textit{in fronte}, and the word order of \textit{acies secunda} occurs only here. Furthermore, in this scenario \textit{paulum} is puzzling, since it seems to indicate a change of course on the part of the \textit{legio} itself: it retreated for a little while, then did something else.\par
\cite{Ciacconius} (cited from \cite{Jungermann} 1606) addressed all five problems as follows:

\begin{quote}… fossam autem transire ut secunda acies conata esset …\end{quote}

\noindent His \textit{secunda acies} is the same unit as the \textit{legio}, but it has experienced a change of heart and now returns to the fray \textit{ut secunda acies}. We don’t need to find any new troops or any event prior to what comes \textit{secundo} (problems 1 and 2), the \textit{legio} is the subject of all of the verbs (problems 3 and 4), and it doesn’t go around the trench but crosses it (problems 4 and 5\footnote{\cite{Dauisius1727} took a different approach to problem 4, proposing \textit{circuitu} in place of \textit{transitu}. But this makes problem 5 worse.}). He also makes sense of \textit{paulum}: the legion retreated briefly, but (\textit{autem}) renewed the attack, and restores the standard word order. However, the repetition of \textit{ut} is rather awkward, and \textit{auersa} is a discordant detail: one would like to know what turned the legion back around to face the enemy. In any case, given the complicated series of innovations that would have been required to get from this original to the transmitted text, Ciacconius is appropriately doubtful about the likelihood of his solution, especially since he also rewrote the first part of the sentence (\textit{cum paululum auersus hostis cessisset}).\footnote{“Nimia est licentia” says \cite{Dauisius1727} (1727, ad loc). \cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.) offers a tentative emendation, \textit{acriter secundo \supplied{impetu facto}}, that is almost equally drastic and solves fewer problems.}\par
\cite{Madvig} (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=295}{283–284}) created a similar scenario with a simpler repair:

\begin{quote}… fossam autem circumire acie secunda conata esset …\end{quote}

\noindent His \textit{acie secunda} expresses the change of heart without changing the word order or duplicating the \textit{ut}, and he improved the passage further by emending \textit{auersa} to \textit{aduersa}: although under pressure, the legion faced the enemy, as Caesar’s troops had done in another chaotic scene at Alexandria (20.5 \textit{magnam uim telorum aduersi sustinerent}). As was noted in (C) above, the prefix of \textit{auersa} may repeat that of \textit{auersos} in 40.1, and in any case the innovation \textit{aduersa} =\textit{auersa} is not implausible. This emendation thus addresses problems (1)–(3). And problems (4) and (5) solve themselves if we see \textit{circumire} and \textit{in transitu} as two stages of an single advance comparable to that described more methodically in 40.1. But \textit{acie secunda} creates its own problems: the unusual word order may prompt the reader to see this \textit{acies} not as a military formation (which would be odd with \textit{legio} as the subject of \textit{conata esset}) but as the more abstract “battle” ({\itshape TLL} 1.409.41–81, with no examples from the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}), but in a context where military formations are so prevalent this seems unlikely.\footnote{Variations on this approach depart further from the transmitted text: \textit{accessu secundo} \cite{Hoffmann1857}; \textit{acie excedendo} \cite{Oehler} (1852); \textit{consilio secundo} \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=643}{565}).}\par
Excision has also been applied to the problems of this passage, without much plausibility since it is unclear what would motivate the addition of words so plainly alien to the context as \textit{acies} and \textit{secundo}.\par
The efficiency of Nipperdey’s emendation, which like that of Ciacconius deals with all five problems at once, makes up for its lack of palaeographical plausibility: 

\begin{quote}… fossam autem circumire ac transcendere conata esset …\end{quote}

\noindent His \textit{ac transcendere} crisply eliminates \textit{acies} and \textit{secundo} and justifies \textit{transitu}. The verb is used of crossing trenches at {\itshape BC} 3.46.3 \textit{ut fossas transcenderent}. In our view this is the best of the available repairs, particularly when combined with Madvig’s \textit{aduersa}. If it is right, \textit{acies} and \textit{secundo} may be further persistence errors: forms of the former occur eight times in the preceding three paragraphs, and \textit{secundum}, as was mentioned above, was used in 40.1, where it is preceded by the word \textit{adeo}. But perhaps the problem lies deeper, as Klotz suggests by daggering the passage.

\endgroup

\noindent Chapter 46 is part of the narrative of Vatinius’ \textit{res gestae} after the battle of Pharsalus (43.3–47). This narrative starts and ends in Brundisium, but our passage belongs to Vatinius’ naval operations on the coast of Illyricum, where he was vying with the Pompeian fleet commander M. Octavius. Vatinius’ “fleet” was a motley collection of a few warships and a larger number of light vessels retrofitted with rostra (44.2–4), and Octavius knew it (45.1). Catching Vatinius off guard in a storm Octavius decided to attack, whereupon Vatinius rapidly prepared his fleet for battle. The general urgency of the task of stopping Octavius’ depredations was made clear earlier (44.1–3), but Vatinius’ reasoning at this critical moment is given in the following sentence, which contains a puzzling string of nouns, a murky \textit{cum} clause, and an elliptical verb:

\begin{quote}Vatinius cum animaduerteret neque nauium se magnitudine neque numero parem esse fortuitae dimicationi fortunae rem committere maluit.\end{quote}

\noindent Vatinius preferred battle—to what? Evasive action, presumably, but Incertus does not specify. If specification is wanted, one could emend \textit{maluit}, as the scribe of T did, or fill in the blank, as \cite{Kübler1896a} did:

\begin{quote}… dimicationi fortunae \supplied{tamen quam fugae} … maluit\end{quote}

\noindent But the supplement is superfluous, since \textit{quam} (uel sim.) is not obligatory (cf. {\itshape BC} 1.72.3 \textit{quibus saluis atque incolumibus rem obtinere malebat} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{quam interfectis}) and see {\itshape TLL} 8.201.78–202.8). And T’s \textit{noluit} doesn’t fit the context very well, since in the following sentence (quoted above) we learn that Vatinius attacked Octavius before Octavius could attack him, and the connective \textit{itaque} indicates that the attack was a consequence of Vatinius’ preference.\footnote{One might also take \textit{fortuitae dimicationi} with \textit{parem} (cf. {\itshape BG} 1.40.7 \textit{pares esse nostro exercitui}) and \textit{fortunae} with \textit{rem committere}, but this makes Vatinius irrational in what is otherwise a highly flattering narrative: “although he realized that he was not equal … to a chance engagement, he preferred to entrust the matter to chance.”}\par
\cite{Kübler1896a}’s repair also includes \textit{tamen}, which clarifies the concessive nature of the \textit{cum} clause; others had added it elsewhere. But this too, although an improvement, seems unwarranted, since many of Incertus’ \textit{cum} clauses, especially in chapters 34–47, are murky owing to postponed conjunctions and complicated syntax (see, e.g., 34.2, 35.2, 36.3, 39.1, 40.2, 42.3, 44.1, 44.3). The antithesis between calculation (\textit{magnitudine}, \textit{numero, parem}) and chance (\textit{fortuitae}, \textit{fortunae}) may suffice to indicate the concession that Incertus intended.\par
But the expression \textit{fortuitae dimicationi fortunae rem committere} is distinctly unlovely. \textit{Rem committere} could go with \textit{dimicationi} (cf. {\itshape BC} 2.33.2 \textit{proelio rem committere}; 2.38.2, 3.74.2) or \textit{fortunae} (cf. Liu. 9.12.11 \textit{committere rem fortunae}) but not with both, so \textit{fortunae} must be genitive. But if \textit{fortunae} is a subjective genitive dependent on \textit{dimicationi} (for the construction see {\itshape TLL 5.1.1197.21–34), fortuitae} is tautological. And if \textit{fortuitae} modifies \textit{fortunae}, it is otiose. In short, something has to go. Suspicion has fallen on \textit{fortuitae} owing to the word’s scant presence in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum} ({\itshape BG} 7.20.2 \textit{omnia fortuito et sine consilio accidere}; cf. {\itshape BAfr} 3.5 \textit{fortuitu}). \textit{Fortuna}, of course, is a favorite Caesarian concept (⟩70x, including recently at 43.1 and 43.3).\par
\textit{Fortuitae} was emended to an adjectival \textit{futurae} already in the \textit{recentiores} (cf. {\itshape BC} 1.52.1 \textit{futuri temporis timore}). This improves the style but runs counter to the sense, since Vatinius did not wait for a future engagement. The scribe of T omitted \textit{fortuitae dimicationi}, presumably regarding it as an alternative to \textit{fortunae}. Modern scholars, on the other hand, excise \textit{fortunae} as a gloss on the more unusual expression \textit{fortuitae dimicationi}. Their decision seems right. But T may have been right in seeing the two as variants transmitted by the archetype.\footnote{See \cite{Damon2015a} (2015a, xxiv-xxv), pointing to the lists in \cite{Hering} (1963, 42–43) and \cite{Klotz} (1927, XII). The present passage is not in either.}

\endgroup

\noindent This sentence describes the ships captured by Vatinius after defeating Octavius near the island of Tauris (45–46; mod. Šćedro in Croatia). Three types of ship are mentioned here. The term for the largest ship, as transmitted, is a bizarre bilingual hybrid, \textit{penteremem}. This certainly refers to what is elsewhere called a \textit{quinqueremis} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{nauis}; 13.4, 13.5, 16.6, 46.1, etc.). The same hybrid probably stood in the archetype at {\itshape BAfr} 62.5 (penteremes \textit{MU} : pentemeres \textit{T} : pentymeres \textit{V} : penteres \textit{S}), whence it was corrected in S to a Latin form, \textit{penteres}, modeled on \textit{trieris} (= \textit{τριήρης}).\footnote{\textit{Trieris} is correctly transmitted at {\itshape BAfr} 44.2 \textit{nauis trieris}; it also appears at Nep. \textit{Alc}. 4.3 and at Sal. \textit{H}. fr. inc. 11 Maurenbrecher. A similarly formed word, \textit{hexeris}, occurs three times in Livy (29.9.8, 37.23.5, 37.30.2). Outside of the two occurrences in the Caesarian corpus, \textit{penteris} is only found in Isid. {\itshape Orig.} 19.1.23. On the names of Roman warships see recently M. Guérin, “La série des lexies biremis/triremis/quadriremis/quinqueremis navis: Une curiosité morphologique et sémantique,” in: P. Duarte et al., eds., {\itshape Histoires de mots: Études de linguistique latine et de linguistique générale offertes en hommage à Michèle Fruyt}. Paris. 135–153.} In the present passage \textit{penteremem} was emended to \textit{penterem} by \cite{Stephanus} in 1544, and the Greek cognate sits comfortably in a sentence that also contains \textit{dicrotas} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{naues} = \textit{δίκροτας ναῦς}). Although the numerical portion of such compounds may occasionally have been indicated with a Roman numeral in the archetype (\textit{Vremes} appears in M and V at {\itshape BC} 3.111.3, for example), it seems unlikely that a scribe expanded \textit{V} to \textit{pente}-. The innovation probably arose under pressure from the other -\textit{remis} compounds in the vicinity, including \textit{triremes} in the same list (cf. 46.1 \textit{quinqueremi} and \textit{quadriremem}, 46.5 \textit{quadriremis}).\par
\cite{Stadler} (1907, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112023962035?urlappend=\%3Bseq=578}{1119}) proposed adding one more Greek-derived boat term to this list, emending \textit{remiges} to \textit{celoces}. But the capture of rowers with their boats is reported in another “cost-of-battle” summary earlier in the text (16.6 \textit{capitur hoc proelio quinqueremis una et biremis cum defensoribus remigibusque}; cf. {\itshape BC} 3.24.3 \textit{quadriremem cum remigibus defensoribusque suis ceperunt}, {\itshape BAfr} 63.3 \textit{triremem … onustam remigum epibatarumque cepit}), so the repair seems superfluous.\par
\cite{Schneider}’s excision of \textit{ex}, on the model of 16.6 (quoted above), has better justification, but it too seems unnecessary, since Vatinius’ possession of the enemy ships may have arisen “in connection with that battle” or “from that battle,” i.e., during (cf. 46.5) and after it. It is clear from the narrative that Octavius abandoned his fleet to its fate, since in his flight he was only accompanied by a few small ships that “chance had preserved” (46.6–7, esp. \textit{naues nonnullae quas casus … uindicarat}; 47.4 \textit{paruis paucisque nauigiis}).\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} prints \textit{ex} but translates “dans cet engagement.”} The construction at {\itshape BAfr} 40.5 \textit{nonnulli ex Curionis proelio capti} is similar, and refers to noncombatants taken prisoner after a battle in which the commander perished ({\itshape BC} 2.44.2).

\noindent The misdeeds of Caesar’s representative in Spain, Q. Cassius, caused serious disturbances, particularly in further Spain, where Cassius had been quaestor some years earlier (48.1).\footnote{He was in Spain as \textit{Pompey’s} representative in the late 50s BCE (\cite{Broughton} 1952, 2.236, supplemented at 1986, 3.52), which may be why the narrative here is left rather vague.} The report of his abuse of the civilian population starts in a sentence that has attracted emendations with strikingly different meanings:

\begin{quote}Cassius legionibus in hiberna dispositis ad ius dicendum Cordubam se recepit contractumque in ea aes alienum grauissimis oneribus prouinciae constituit exsoluere.\end{quote}

\noindent The syntax is fine, but the meaning of \textit{in ea} is unclear. The demonstrative seems to point back to Corduba, but if it does, it refers to debts that have not been mentioned. It is possible that they were incurred during his earlier stint in Spain, but the specificity of the reference to Corduba is puzzling, since this is its first occurrence in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}.\footnote{Corduba will later defect from Cassius (57.5, 58.4), but his debts are not mentioned in that connection.}\par
A variety of substitutes for the offending demonstrative have been suggested.\par
\cite{Jurinius} (1742, ad loc.) supplied an adjective:

\begin{quote}Cassius … ad ius dicendum Cordubam se recepit contractumque ingens aes alienum … constituit exsoluere.\end{quote}

\noindent The “huge debt” mentioned here is, in his view, the result of Cassius’ recent largesse to the soldiers, described immediately above (48.2–3)\footnote{This meant to win the affection of the army and counterbalance the hostility of the province (48.1 \textit{compensare offensionem prouinciae exercitus amore cupiebat}).} and alluded to in the following sentence (quoted above for context). However, \textit{ingens} is used nowhere else by Incertus, and in its infrequent occurrences in Caesar’s \textit{commentarii} it does not modify anything comparable to \textit{aes alienum} ({\itshape BG} 1.39.1 and 5.3.4 \textit{magnitudine}, 4.10.4 \textit{insulis}, 5.12.3 \textit{numerus}). For a “vast indebtedness” one has to turn to Sallust (\textit{Cat}. 16.4 \textit{aes alienum per omnis terras ingens erat}; cf. Liu. 7.21.8 \textit{uis ingens aeris alieni}).\par
\cite{Madvig} (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=296}{284}), noting that if \textit{in ea} refers to Corduba, the expression ought to be \textit{in ea urbe}, suggested two replacements for it, an ablative noun and a temporal adverb:

\begin{quote}Cassius … ad ius dicendum Cordubam se recepit contractumque alea aes alienum … constituit exsoluere\end{quote}


\begin{quote}Cassius … ad ius dicendum Cordubam se recepit contractumque antea aes alienum … constituit exsoluere\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Alea} has little to recommend it apart from its final two letters, since nothing in the narrative connects the cause of Cassius’ indebtedness with the measures he took to to remedy it; gambling would be a stray detail. \textit{Antea} is a little better, since Incertus did mention Cassius’ earlier office in Spain, and the temporal adverb does not point specifically to Corduba. However, it adds nothing to the sense, since the participle \textit{contractum} itself indicates priority.\par
\cite{Menge} (1889, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098630197?urlappend=\%3Bseq=160}{126}) suggested a different temporal adverb:

\begin{quote}Cassius … ad ius dicendum Cordubam se recepit contractumque interea aes alienum … constituit exsoluere\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Interea} is closer to the paradosis, and Menge (ibid.) explains it as a reference to the time “während er Recht spricht.” But the word order associates it closely with \textit{contractum} and makes it point to an unspecified period of time between Cassius’ quaestorship and praetorship and events nowhere mentioned in the \textit{commentarii}.\par
Since none of the available repairs is significantly less problematic than the transmitted text,\footnote{In his translation \cite{Carter} (1997, ad loc.) seems to omit \textit{in ea} and all its replacements and take \textit{contractum} with \textit{grauissimis oneribus}: “He decided to pay off debts of his which had caused great hardship to the province.” He then implies that Cassius’ repayment constituted the largesse mentioned in the following sentence.} we join the editors who print \textit{in ea}, and explain the demonstrative as proleptic. As we saw above, \cite{Madvig} objected to the absence of a noun with \textit{ea}. But there is a similar ellipsis at 47.3 \textit{in ea} (sc. \textit{insula}), referring to Issa. In our view, however, the ellided word is not \textit{urbe} but \textit{prouincia}. That is, the demonstrative anticipates a substantive that comes later in the sentence: \textit{contractumque in ea} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{prouincia}) \textit{aes alienum grauissimis oneribus \uline{prouinciae} constituit exsoluere}. The fact that Cassius was guilty of financial irregularities during previous tenure is mentioned at 50.1 (\textit{cum Longinus imperator eadem faceret quae fecerat quaestor}) and suggested by the assassination attempt mentioned at 48.1 (\textit{ex insidiis ibi uulneratus}), although it is unclear how these irregularities left him him debt.\footnote{See further the discussion of 49.2 \textit{causae tenues}. This train of thought is not convincing.} There is a more extreme prolepsis at 12.2, where \textit{eas} points to \textit{naues}, 14 words later:

\begin{quote}Idem, posteaquam Ganymedes in concilio confirmauit sese et eas quae essent amissae restituturum et numerum adaucturum, magna spe et fiducia ueteres reficere naues accuratiusque huic rei studere atque inseruire instituerunt.\end{quote}

\noindent On this reading, Cassius accumulated this debt during his time in Spain as Pompey’s representative, and he used his recent largesse to the soldiers as an excuse for extortion and financial chicanery (described in the following sentences), some of the proceeds of which went to canceling his debt.

\noindent Chapter 49 concerns the finances of Caesar’s governor in Further Spain, Q. Cassius Longinus, particularly his extortion of money from the Spaniards. The first sentence supplies necessary context: one of Cassius’ goals was to reduce his personal debt (49.1 \textit{contractum in ea} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{prouincia}] \textit{aes alienum … constituit exsoluere}). Incertus devotes four sentences to the governor’s procedures, but problems in the transmitted text of the first part of the second sentence obscure the details (the rest of the passage is quoted above for context):

\begin{quote}in gregem locupletium simultatium causa(e) tenues coniciebantur.\end{quote}

\noindent The main problems are (1) uncertainty about the reading of the archetype at \textit{causa}(\textit{e)}, which creates uncertainty about the subject of the sentence: is it \textit{causae} or \textit{tenues}? (2) The awkwardness of adjacent genitives dependent on different substantives (\textit{locupletium} on \textit{gregem}, \textit{simultatium} on \textit{causa}[\textit{e}]). And (3) the meaning of \textit{simultatium}: what kinds of disputes does Incertus have in mind?\footnote{The peculiar expression \textit{in gregem locupletium} is queried by \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=646}{568}), who notes that Cassius preyed on the wealthy as individuals, via requisition and lawsuit, not as a collective. But \textit{grex} seems compatible with the hyperbole of the passage (\textit{neque ullum genus … nemo erat … quin}). See below for an emendation to \textit{coniciebantur}.}\par
All of these problems are rendered more intractable by uncertainty about the bookkeeping procedure specified in \textit{sibi expensas ferri} in the previous sentence. Similar accounting language recurs in the following paragraph in connection with members of Cassius’ inner circle, his \textit{familiares}, who “were in the habit of crediting to themselves whatever they had seized and assigning to Cassius whatever sums were due for payment or subject to claims (50.2 \textit{sibi … quod rapuerant acceptum referebant}, \textit{quod interciderat aut erat interpellatum Cassio assignabant}), but in 50.2 the technical terms seem less technical than those in the present passage, referring to who got what, not which category (income or expenditure?) a sum was assigned to.\footnote{However, \cite{Schneider} (1888, ad loc.) views the accounting language in 49.2, too, as used loosely, such that \textit{expensum ferre} simply means “pay.”} However, the later passage, along with \textit{domus} in 49.2, does suggest that these same \textit{familiares} are envisaged as acting on Cassius’ orders in our passage (\textit{cogebat}) and entering sums received as sums paid, i.e., putting those from whom Cassius had extorted money into his debt for the amount they had just paid him, potentially doubling their loss should he try to collect on those “debts,” and in any case making it impossible for them to demand restitution in the future. As \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=645}{567–568}, n. 47) explains, this would be a precautionary measure adopted in view of future lawsuits, where account books could be entered as evidence. However, it is unclear whose account books are at issue here: his or theirs? In the scenario described here it is assumed that the books are those of Cassius, since after the assassination attempt he convoked those who had paid him money and seems to have ordered them to alter the entries in their account books as well: 56.3 \textit{sanatis uulneribus arcessit omnes qui sibi pecunias expensas tulerant acceptasque eas iubet referri}. But in this scenario \textit{patiebatur} is surprising,\footnote{As is noted by \cite{Vielhaber1869} (1869, 567–568, n. 47). He suggests that the account books in both 49.2 and 56.3 are those of the provincials, and that Cassius wants to ensure that any expenditures recorded there correspond to subsequent income, indicating that their “loans” had been repaid.} unless we are to assume that his profit-hungry \textit{familiares} were pressing this procedure on Cassius. Further confusion arises from Incertus’ report that Cassius had operated similarly as quaestor (50.1 \textit{cum Longinus imperator eadem faceret quae fecerat quaestor}), since his earlier tenure resulted in debt and his goal in 48/47 is to clear that debt. But perhaps the point of the present passage is that he changed his bookkeeping procedures so that instead of incurring debt he emerged as his victims’ creditor.\par
Some basic orientation can be derived from the insistent binaries in the passage quoted above: requisition vs. prosecution, large and visible profit vs. small and sordid profit, \textit{domus} vs. \textit{tribunal}, financial risks (\textit{uadimonio … iacturas … detrimenta rei familiaris}) vs. criminal charges (\textit{in reos … periculorum}). Incertus’ Cassius seems to have applied pressure both directly and indirectly in pursuit of money to pay his debts.\par
The first of the problems listed above is the most consequential. Should we read \textit{causae} or \textit{causa}? Editors from \cite{Nipperdey} onwards have read \textit{causa}, Nipperdey (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=205}{197}) because he considered it the reading of the best manuscript, others on the basis of the then-current stemma, where the agreement of S and TV showed the reading of the archetype. But with the bifid stemma used in the present edition \textit{causa} and \textit{causae} have equal authority, and either might have turned into the other owing to pressure from the adjacent words, \textit{simultatium} and \textit{tenues}.\footnote{\cite{Andrieu} (1954, 85) asserts in his note complémentaire on this passage that \textit{causae} “a toute chance d’être une correction,” but \textit{causa} could as easily have arisen from the preceding genitive.}\par
\textit{Causa}, the reading of the nu-branch, is a preposition-like ablative with \textit{simultatium} (cf. Var. \textit{L.} 5.155 \textit{litium causa}). With this reading the subject of \textit{coniciebantur} is the substantival \textit{tenues}, “people of modest means.” Neither \textit{simultatium causa} nor \textit{tenues coniciebantur} is easy to understand, however. \cite{Nipperdey} (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=205}{197}) paraphrases the sentence thus: “homines tenues, quia Longino erant inuisi, eadem passos esse, quae locupletes.” But \textit{simultatium causa} seems like an odd way to communicate Cassius’ hostility, and translations are tellingly disparate. Nipperdey’s interpretation of \textit{causa}, with its causal (“because of”) rather than purposive (“for the sake of”) meaning\textit{,} is reflected in some translations, e.g.:\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Andrieu} (1954): “en cas de démêlés avec lui, le petit peuple était jeté dans la masse des riches.”
\item \cite{Carter} (1997):“Men of modest means were lumped in with the rich because of private quarrels.”\end{itemize} \par
Other translators, however, give \textit{causa} its customary sense\footnote{As in Varro’s similar phrase \textit{L}. 5.155 \textit{litium causa}, which occurs in the etymology of Comitium, \textit{ab eo quod coibant eo comitiis curiis et litium causa}.} but struggle to understand \textit{simultatium}, e.g.:\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Ciaffi-Griffa} (2008 [1953/1972]): “includeva poi le persone di condizione modesta nella massa de ricchi per confondere le cose.”
\item \cite{Raaflaub} (2017): “People of modest means were classed with the rich arbitrarily in order to stir up social tensions.”\footnote{“Classed with the rich” is an effective way of dealing with \textit{in gregem … coniciebantur} (cf. \textit{BHisp} 22.7 \textit{siqui ex nostris transfugerent in leuem armaturam conici}), but “arbritrarily” has no basis in the text.}
\item \cite{Landgraf1888}: “gegen das Corps der Reichen wurden \textit{simultatium causa} die Armen aufgewiegelt” (see below for the verb translated here).\end{itemize} \par
The difficulty of \textit{simultatium causa} prompted \cite{Schneider} to emend the genitive:

\begin{quote}in gregem locupletium simulationis causa tenues coniciebantur.\end{quote}

\noindent \cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.), who prints \textit{simulationis causa}, explains it as follows: “i. in numerum eorum quibus pecuniae imperabantur, etiam pauperes referebantur, ne locupletium divitias peti appareret.” But Incertus’ Cassius is unconcerned about his public image—for another of his flagrant abuses see note \ref{stba-49.2-note-9} in this section—indeed he so provokes the provincials that he is the target of two unsuccessful assassination attempts and a successful defection.\par
Furthermore, the context makes it problematic to take \textit{tenues} as the subject of \textit{coniciebantur}, since it is clear that Cassius favored wealthy targets: 49.3 \textit{Nemo erat \uline{qui modo aliquam iacturam facere posset} quin aut uadimonio teneretur aut in reos referretur}. To address this problem \cite{Landgraf1888} (1888, \xref{https://archive.org/details/untersuchungenzu00landuoft/page/48}{49}) emended the verb:

\begin{quote}in gregem locupletium simultatium causa tenues conciebantur.\end{quote}

\noindent With this reading the \textit{tenues} are not Cassius’ targets (real or simulated) but his tools: he arouses them to initiate prosecutions that they will profit from, but intends to profit from their profits himself. \cite{Landgraf1889} (1889, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044085186245?urlappend=\%3Bseq=17}{13}) later claimed that the passage should be viewed as “definitiv geheilt.” His repair does permit a logical connection to the preceding sentence about largesse (49.1 \textit{Et, ut largitionis postulat consuetudo, per causam liberalitatis speciosam plura largitori quaerebantur}): these prosecutions will count as largesse for the tools. But in a context where actual largesse has been mentioned (48.2–3) and will be mentioned again (52.1) the connection seems rather tenuous, and \cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.) deems Landgraf’s verb ill-suited to the context.\par
With the reading of the mu-branch, \textit{causae}, by contrast, the sentence is relatively straightforward. \textit{Causae} is the subject of \textit{coniciebantur}. The metaphorical weaponizing of lawsuits is part of Latin legal language already in the Twelve Tables (cf. \textit{ante meridiem causam coniciunto,} quoted at {\itshape Gell. 17.2.10)}.\footnote{Cf. Gell. 5.10.9 \textit{Et cum ad iudices coniciendae consistendaeque causae gratia uenissent}. For \textit{causae coniectio} as a legal expression see {\itshape TLL} 4.311.84–312.4.} And the expression \textit{causae tenues} is used by Cicero at \textit{Orat}. 124, where it denotes cases that don’t allow the orator to use the full range of his power. Here it seems rather to indicate frivolous lawsuits that a defendant with money might pay to be free of.\footnote{Cassius later used a similarly profitable abuse of power in levying troops from the well-off class of \textit{equites Romani}: 56.4 {\itshape Quos ex omnibus conuentibus coloniisque conscriptos, transmarina militia perterritos, ad sacramenti redemptionem uocabat. Magnum hoc fuit uectigal, maius tamen creabat odium}.\label{stba-49.2-note-9}}\par
\textit{Simultatium} is still a problem, however, indeed a worse problem than it was with \textit{causa}. The awkwardness of its position next to \textit{locupletium} was mentioned above, and with \textit{causae} the genitive is ambiguous. The other occurrence of \textit{simultates} in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum} refers to the contests between Pullo and Vorenus ({\itshape BG} 5.44.2 \textit{summis simultatibus}), and at {\itshape BC} 2.25.4 the singular refers to a dispute involving Curio and Pompey. But “trivial causes of contests (or disputes)” seems to give Cassius’ victims too much agency: why give them reasons to fight him? The term can also denote lawsuits (e.g., Liu. 39.5.2 \textit{alienarum uero simultatium tribunum plebis cognitorem fieri turpe … esse}), but neither “causes of lawsuits” (objective genitive) nor “cases, i.e., lawsuits” (defining genitive) seems likely here.\par
A long-neglected 16\textsuperscript{th}-century emendation improves the sense signficantly:

\begin{quote}in gregem locupletium simul et causa tenues conciebantur.\end{quote}

\noindent This was proposed by the humanist Latinus Latinius (1513–1593) and published posthumously in a catalog of \cite{Latinius}’ emendations (1677, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101076454485?urlappend=\%3Bseq=262}{2.26}). \textit{Simul et} links the two modes of extortion used by Cassius in Corduba and is equivalent to \textit{simul etiam}\footnote{The usage is Ciceronian (⟩10x) and Livian (⟩10x), not Caesarian. \textit{Simul et} does appear in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, but only in tandem with a second \textit{et}: e.g., {\itshape BG} 7.48.4 \textit{simul et cursu et spatio pugnae defatigati}.}; \textit{et} seems preferable to \textit{etiam} to avoid clashes with \textit{sed etiam} (above) and \textit{magna etiam} (below). The text that results resembles Liv. 2.6.10 in its structure: \textit{\uline{simul et} cetera equestris pugna coepit, \uline{neque} ita multo post et pedites superueniunt}. The innovation may have started as a persistence error repetition of the ending of \textit{locupletium}, and been “corrected” by accommodation to \textit{causa}(e).

\noindent In chapter 60 the rebellion against Cassius has reached a point where armed conflict seems inevitable. Of the five legions originally controlled by Cassius two and a half have mutinied (57.1–5) and put themselves under the leadership of the quaestor M. Marcellus (59.1). Marcellus’ forces are based in Corduba itself, Cassius’ are on high ground across the Baetis River, about four miles distant (59.1). Cassius has taken the initiative by ravaging Cordoban fields and buildings outside the city (59.2), and Marcellus’ troops demand action (60.1). In the present sentence Marcellus does act, but with considerable reluctance, the grounds for which are only partly clear in the text as transmitted, which is printed by \cite{Nipperdey} and other editors (here with Nipperdey’s punctuation):

\begin{quote}Marcellus, cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum, neque suae potestatis \uline{esset,} legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit.\end{quote}

\noindent This \textit{cum} clause, like others in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, is complex.\footnote{See, e.g., 34.2, 35.2, 36.3, 39.1, 40.2, 42.3, 44.1, 44.3, 63.4.} It contains two verbs, \textit{putaret} (governing indirect statement) and \textit{esset}, connected by \textit{neque}, and an inset \textit{quod} clause including an emphatic genitive construction \textit{et uictoris et uicti}. Plus, one has to extract \textit{confligere} from the indirect statement dependent on \textit{putaret} to serve as the subject of \textit{esset}. The syntax is perhaps tolerable, although the \textit{variatio} in the modifiers of \textit{confligere} is more suited to the style of Tacitus than to that of Incertus. However, the meaning of \textit{suae potestatis esset} is unclear: does it allude to Marcellus’ probable inability to control his troops? This would align with the order Cassius gave him earlier, to retain control of Corduba (57.4 \textit{ut eam} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{Cordubam}] \textit{in potestate retineret}) and his own subsequent prediction about the difficulty of controlling the troops (61.4 \textit{necessitate est adductus, ut neque confligeret—cuius si rei facultas esset resistere incitatis militibus non poterat—neque uagari Cassium latius pateretur}). But the former passage refers to a civilian population and in the latter passage Incertus specifies that it is resistance to the soldiers’ impetuosity that would be impossible, not fighting per se. Plus, it seems odd for him to assert that fighting is not in Marcellus’ power when the quaestor is about to take his troops across the river and array them for battle (\textit{legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit}). \textit{Potestas} may, however, allude to the fact that Marcellus does not have \textit{imperium}; the mutinous legions call him “praetor” (59.1), as they had done to earlier leaders (53.4, cf. 57.3), but his magistracy is in fact a quaestorship (57.4). \textit{Potestas} does occasionally denote “official capacity” in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum} ({\itshape BAfr} 4.1 \textit{potestatem … agendi}; 33.2 \textit{aedilicia potestate}; 56.3 \textit{regis … potestatem}; 77.1 \textit{sub dicione et potestate}; for the possessive adjective one may compare {\itshape BG} 4.16.5 \textit{cur sui quicquam esse imperii aut} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{suae}] \textit{potestatis trans Rhenum postularet}). But in all of these passages the meaning of \textit{potestas} is clarified by the presence of other “constitutional” terms. In our passage \textit{potestas} alone would have to denote Marcellus’ authority.\par
Repairs have been sought, with suspicion focusing on the second occurrence of \textit{esset}. The context establishes two parameters for emendation: (1) the \textit{quod} clause must explain the unusually emotional expression \textit{confligere miserrimum} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{esse}), and (2) the \textit{quod} clause must end before \textit{legiones}, which belongs to the main clause.\footnote{This superlative occurs only twice elsewhere in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}: {\itshape BC} 3.96.2 about Caesar’s army at Pharsalus, and Hirt. 8.34.1 about the memory of Alesia.}\par
A relatively simple emendation was already available in the \textit{recentiores}:

\begin{quote}Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret … neque suae potestatis \uline{esse} legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit.\end{quote}

\noindent This emendation simplies the syntax of \textit{confligere} by putting it in a single accusative/infinitive clause with both of its predicates, \textit{miserrimum} and \textit{suae potestatis}. But it does not really solve any of the other problems mentioned above, and the present infinitive seems distinctly odd with the second predicate, which is in effect a prediction about a specific future (note \textit{si … facultas esset} in 61.4) rather than a generalization about conflict.\footnote{\cite{Kübler1896a} (1896, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/osu.32435027192681?urlappend=\%3Bseq=21}{XIX}) suggested a supplement based on 61.4 (quoted above), which he put into the text after the recentiores’ \textit{esse}: \textit{Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret … neque suae potestatis esse \supplied{uideret militibus pugnandi cupidissimis resistere}, legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit}. However, his supplement moves \textit{esse} into a new indirect statement governed by \textit{uideret}. But it is hard to see how this supplement would have fallen out, and why a scribe would alter the perfectly construable \textit{esse} to \textit{esset}.}\par
Another fairly simple repair was suggested by Ciacconius, who added an infinitive after \textit{esset}. \cite{Jungermann}’s report of the repair (1606, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.31822038197299?urlappend=\%3Bseq=865}{333}) does not indicate whether Ciacconius intended the verb to be part of the \textit{cum} clause (with \textit{neque} connecting \textit{putaret} and \textit{esset}) or part of the \textit{quod} clause (with \textit{neque} connecting \textit{esset redundaturum} and \textit{esset}):

\begin{quote}Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum, neque suae potestatis \uline{{\itshape esset}} \supplied{\uline{uetare uel prohibere}}, legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit.\end{quote}

\noindent or

\begin{quote}Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum neque suae potestatis \uline{esset }\supplied{\uline{uetare {\itshape uel} prohibere}}, legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit.\end{quote}

\noindent In the \textit{cum} clause \textit{esset} requires an awkward shift from concessive sense (“although he thought”) to causal (“since it was not in his power to prevent”). In the \textit{quod} clause it is something of a non sequitur after \textit{confligere miserrimum putaret}.\par
\cite{Larsen} (1886, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=22}{25}) left the matter of what was not in Marcellus’ power open, placing a lacuna after \textit{esset}:

\begin{quote}Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum, neque suae potestatis \uline{esset \gap{}}, legiones Baetim traducit aciemque instruit.\footnote{\cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.) and \cite{Andrieu} (1954, ad loc.) oddly print the recentiores’ \textit{esse} and Larsen’s lacuna.}\end{quote}

\noindent As a supplement one could imagine, say, a second \textit{quod} clause explaining the second verb in the \textit{cum} clause: e.g., \supplied{\textit{quod belli imperium non obtineret}}.\footnote{For \textit{belli imperium} cf. {\itshape BG} 2.4.6 \textit{belli imperium sibi postulare}; for \textit{imperium obtinere} cf. 4.2 \textit{omne imperium obtinebat} (sc. \textit{Arsinoe}), 15.2 \textit{imperium classis obtineret} (sc. \textit{Euphranor}); for the connection between \textit{imperium} and \textit{potestas} {\itshape BG} 7.4.6–7 \textit{ad eum} (sc. \textit{Vercingetorigem}) \textit{defertur imperium. qua oblata potestate}, etc.} But this explanation adds very little, especially by comparison with the first \textit{quod} clause, which justifies the striking word \textit{miserrimum}.\par
Another possibility would be to find a supplement that would place \textit{esset} in the extant \textit{quod} clause, along the lines of Ciacconius’ emendation, discussed above. As an \textit{exempli gratia} supplement based on the subsequent course of events we considered:

\begin{quote}Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum neque suae potestatis \uline{esset }\supplied{\uline{receptus}}, legiones Baetim traducit.\end{quote}

\noindent With this supplement Marcellus would consider combat utterly wretched “because the loss for both the victor and defeated would similarly redound on Caesar and retreat was not in his power.” The phrase \textit{esset receptus} could be misconstrued as a pluperfect verb form, of course, but the same is true at {\itshape BC} 1.45.6 \textit{Hac nostris erat receptus} and {\itshape BC} 3.45.5 \textit{erat per decliue receptus}. However, the difficulties of the terrain are not mentioned until later in the narrative (60.4–5, esp. \textit{cum … quid transitus fluminis uitii difficultatisque haberet cognitum esset}), and the two explanations for \textit{miserrimum} are both strangely dissimilar and strangely arranged, with the proximate and practical worry about retreat placed after the future and general worry about what the battle would cost Caesar. And even if one solves the latter problem by placing a comma before \textit{neque} and making \textit{esset} \supplied{\textit{receptus}} parallel to \textit{putaret}, the fact that we don’t know about the difficulties of the terrain gives pause.\par
In the end we decided that no supplement (and hence no lacuna) is needed here, and that the transmitted text, despite the awkward syntax of \textit{confligere} and the ambiguity of \textit{potestatis}, was acceptable. Marcellus’ worry about the limits of his authority aligns well his subsequent decision to withdraw his troops at the first opportunity (60.3) and with Caesar’s obiter dictum at {\itshape BC} 3.51.4: \textit{aliae … sunt legati partes atque imperatoris}. Marcellus’ loyalty to Caesar is stressed at 59.1, his deference to authority at 63.2 (\textit{huic} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{Lepido}] \textit{uenienti sine dubitatione Marcellus se credit}), and his reluctance to fight is mentioned more forcefully than in the present passage at 61.4 (quoted above). The repairs reported in the apparatus indicate our lingering dissatisfaction with the paradosis and suggest possible approaches for improving it.

\noindent After a tense period in which the two Caesarian armies in Further Spain, one loyal to Caesar’s original legate, Q. Cassius Longinus, the other to Caesar himself but not to Cassius, seem likely to fight one another, a truce is finally arranged at Ulia and the leaders negotiate a resolution that involves releasing Cassius from his present encirclement by demolishing some fortifications (63.1–4). The present sentence concerns a surprise attack during the truce by troops commanded by Cassius’ ally Bogus, king of Mauretania (cf. 59.2, 62.1–2). The transmitted text has an obvious problem: the subjunctives are inexplicable.\footnote{The faulty syntax is signaled in U by a “query” symbol in the left margin and a “caret” symbol above the word \textit{impetum}. A similar system of notation appears on the same page in connection with 64.2 \supplied{\textit{uenit}}.} And the unannounced change of subject from singular to plural in \textit{complanarent} is, if not unparalleled in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} (see \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} 2013, General Index s.v. “syntax: abrupt changes of subject”), at least odd.\par
\cite{Aldus} (1513, ad loc.) made the obvious repair, supplying the conjunction \textit{cum} before \textit{complanarent}:

\begin{quote}Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam constituta opera \supplied{\uline{cum}} complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt.\end{quote}

\noindent The postponement of \textit{cum} is a feature of Incertus’ style (see \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} 2013, 36–39). However, this repair makes the \textit{non tantum … sed} structure oddly imbalanced, with \textit{non tantum} introducing an ablative absolute and \textit{sed} a subordinate clause.\par
\cite{Nipperdey} (1847, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063012838?urlappend=\%3Bseq=208}{200}) addressed the new problem by adding \textit{pace} to create a second ablative absolute with \textit{constituta}:

\begin{quote}Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam \supplied{\uline{pace}} constituta opera \supplied{\uline{cum}} complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt.\end{quote}

\noindent The \textit{opera} are now unmodified, but their identity is clear from the preceding narrative (61.5 \textit{operibus in circuiti oppidi continuatis}, 62.2 \textit{munitiones … ab operibus}); Cassius had demanded their dismantlement (63.4 \textit{postulat uti munitiones disicerentur}). Parallelism has been restored, but it is hard to explain a two-part innovation here: either there were two unrelated omissions or a scribe tried to repair a text that was nonsensical after \textit{cum} was omitted before \textit{con}-. But in the latter case the excision of \textit{pace} is not the most obvious move.\par
\cite{Castiglioni} (1924, 239) suggested that \textit{cum} and \textit{pace} were adjacent when omitted:\par
Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam constituta \supplied{\uline{pace cum}} opera complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt.\par
This simplifies the innovation but weakens the paleographical justification for the omission of \textit{cum}. This repair was adopted by \cite{Klotz} (1927). But the expression \textit{constituta pace} is problematic, since \textit{constituere pacem} appears nowhere in the Caesarian corpus, despite the fact that Caesar refers to many peace negotiations; Caesarian expressions include \textit{pace facta} ({\itshape BG} 2.29.5, 3.1.4), \textit{pace confirmata} ({\itshape BG} 4.48.1), \textit{pace concilianda} ({\itshape BG} 7.55.4, {\itshape BC} 1.26.3, 1.85.2), \textit{pace petita} or \textit{petenda} ({\itshape BG} 4.13.1, 4.27.4). Of the small number of passages listed in the relevant spot of the {\itshape TLL} (\textit{4.515.58–61}), the best parallel comes from Cicero: \textit{Q. fr. 1.1.25} \textit{pacem tota prouincia constitutam}. So we considered two nouns that are used with \textit{constituta}.

\begin{quote}Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam constituta \supplied{\uline{die cum}} opera complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt.\end{quote}


\begin{quote}Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam constituta \supplied{\uline{prouincia cum}} opera complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt.\end{quote}

\noindent Each expression can be parallelled in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}. For \textit{constituere diem} cf. e.g., {\itshape BG} 1.4.2 and {\itshape BC} 3.33.1 \textit{die constituta}; for \textit{constituere prouinciam} cf. 65.1 \textit{praeferendum existimauit} ({\itshape sc}. \textit{Caesar}) \textit{quas in prouincias regionesque uenisset eas … relinquere constitutas.}\footnote{A Ciceronian usage (e.g., Sull. 52 \textit{condicio … constituta est}, Ver. 2.5.157 \textit{te praetore est consitituta condicio}) suggests another possibility: \textit{Non tantum indutiis factis sed prope iam constituta \supplied{\uline{conditione cum}} opera complanarent custodiaeque munitionum essent deductae, auxilia regis … impetum fecerunt}.} But neither omission has any paleographic plausibility.\par
We therefore follow \cite{Andrieu} (1954) in reverting to \cite{Aldus}’ repair. It seems to us that \textit{constituta} goes particularly well with \textit{opera}, since the reference here to the works’ closeness to completion (\textit{prope iam}) is prepared for by the earlier report that Cassius dismissed his cavalry before his opponents could complete their circuit wall (61.6 \textit{quae} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{munitiones}] \textit{prius quam perficerentur Longinus omnem suum equitatum emisit}).\footnote{\textit{Prope iam} is used with perfect passive participles at {\itshape BG} 3.3.3 \textit{prope iam desperata}, 7.29.6 \textit{prope iam effectum}, {\itshape BC} 3.70.1 \textit{prope iam expeditam}.} Furthermore, none of the repairs that couples \textit{constituta} with an ablative suffices to make \textit{non tantum … sed} in the present sentence match the regular usage of \textit{non/neque tantum} (or \textit{solum}) in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, since apart from {\itshape BG} 7.54.4, {\itshape BC} 3.93.6, and \textit{BHisp} 5.6 (all with \textit{non solum}\footnote{The pair \textit{non tantum … sed} (without \textit{etiam}) appears at, e.g., Cic. {\itshape Tusc}. 3.75, Sen. \textit{Contr}. 1.pr. 14 and 18, Col. 3.10.18, Quint. 4.1.16, 5.13.29. The omission of \textit{etiam} (and its like) becomes commoner starting with the younger Seneca.} ), \textit{sed} always appears with reinforcements: \textit{etiam} (30x), \textit{paene} ({\itshape BG} 1.20.5, {\itshape BC} 3.32.2), \textit{paene etiam} ({\itshape BG} 6.11.2), \textit{ne … quidem} ({\itshape BAlex} 8.3).\footnote{The existence of Incertus’ other unique usage at 8.3 persuades us to leave \textit{prope iam} in the text, but we propose \textit{prope etiam} in the apparatus on the model of {\itshape BG} 6.11.2 \textit{in Gallia non solum in omnibus ciuitatibus atque in omnibus pagis partibusque, sed paene etiam in singulis domibus factiones sunt}.} Admittedly, the coupling of a circumstantial ablative and a circumstantial \textit{cum} clause is an even more striking oddity, unique in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}. Columella uses \textit{non tantum} … \textit{sed} to couple an ablative with temporal clause (12.52.14 \textit{non tantum eo tempore curanda sunt} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{dolia}], \textit{cum fructus necessitas cogit}, \textit{sed ubi fuerint … uacuata}), but the equivalence of \textit{eo tempore} and \textit{ubi} is considerably easier than that in our passage. The repairs reported in the apparatus indicate our distrust of the transmitted text.\par
As for \textit{complanarent}, a verb that appears nowhere else in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}, the transmitted active form is hard to construe (no subject) and parallel (the best is Sen. \textit{Dial}. 1.5.9 \textit{quae … conplanet ipse}). In emending the verb to a passive form \cite{Kübler1896a} makes the syntax simpler, but here again the best parallel comes from outside the corpus (Cic. \textit{Dom.} 101 \textit{domus est complanata}), so it is hard to feel confident that he is right. And it seems rash to emend when the subject of \textit{complanarent} could have fallen out with \textit{cum}.

\noindent The problems in this passage about Caesar’s journey from Cilicia to Pontus through Cappadocia are both historical and textual. Both center on the word \textit{Comana}.\par
The main historical problem is the identity of Comana. There are two cities called Comana in Cappadocia and Cappadocian Pontus, but it is hard to say which is meant here, since the information supplied by the reference to the famous temple of Bellona, which points to the Cappadocian city, conflicts with the route deduced from the prior reference to Mazaca, the capital of Cappadocia: a journey to Comana after two days at Mazaca would have taken Caesar away from Pontus and the coming fight with Pharnaces, towards which, as the passages stresses, he was hastening eagerly (66.3 \textit{cupiditate proficiscendi ad bellum gerendum non diutius moratur}; 66.5 \textit{simili uelocitate}). A secondary problem is the apparently unmotivated two-day stop in Mazaca, which is hard to ignore given the incompatibility of \textit{non diutius moratur} and \textit{commoratus}.\par
The main textual problem is the absence of a main verb for the second part of the opening compound sentence (\textit{magnisque … habeatur}). This obscures the syntax of \textit{Comana uetustissimum et sanctissimum in Cappadocia Bellonae templum}. Are \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} nominative? accusative? in apposition? The secondary textual problems indicated in the apparatus involve the asyndetic list of ablatives of respect (66.3 \textit{maiestate imperio potentia}) and the position of the ablative absolute (66.4 \textit{iure minime dubio, uetustate tamen intermisso}); neither needs discussion here.\par
An early repair to the main textual problem, the addition of \textit{uenit} before \textit{Comana}, completed the syntax and made \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} accusative. But it left the two in uncomfortable apposition. \cite{Nipperdey}’s placement of \textit{uenit} after \textit{Comana} instead of before allows one to explain the verb’s omission as a jump from \textit{uen}- to \textit{uet}-. But the apposition is still a problem, and both repairs exacerbate the historical problems by apparently having Caesar detour to Cappadocian Comana after an unproductive stay in Mazaca. \cite{Madvig} declared the supplement misguided and the text sound, taking \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} (still in apposition) as objects of \textit{adiudicauit} and explaining the closer object \textit{id} as a resumptive pronoun necessitated by the distance between Comana and its verb (31 words). His analysis of the syntax is not entirely persuasive—why \textit{id}, not \textit{ea,} which would remove the apposition by making \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} parallel objects in asyndeton?—but on his reading the problem of Caesar’s route through Cappadocia disappears (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=297}{285}): “Mazacae, non Comanis, de templo statuit.” Caesar made his decision about Comana and the temple without going there. The solution is particularly appealing because the following sentence, although somewhat opaque owing to its lacuna, clearly concerns decisions pertaining to Cappadocian royalty, whose seat was in Mazaca. Madvig’s explanation also supplies welcome information about why a hurrying Caesar spent two days in Mazaca: two days for two decisions about the future administration of a powerful priesthood and a kingdom. But syntax of the transmitted text remains unsatisfactory, and subsequent editors, including \cite{Klotz} and \cite{Andrieu}, have posited, with \cite{Kübler1896a}, a multi-word lacuna between \textit{Comana} and \textit{uetustissimum}.\par
The possibility that our Comana is in Cappadocian Pontus rather than Cappadocia proper is suggested by Strabo, a native of Pontus adolescent in 47 BCE, who in discussing Comana Pontica in his {\itshape Geography} says that it had a temple modeled on the one in Cappadocia and once had a priest named Lycomedes, and echoes the description of the priesthood’s importance, which had earlier been held by Strabo’s own great-great-grandfather (12.3.32–36). Strabo tells us that the tenure of the priesthood in Comana Pontica had been a bone of contention from Sulla onwards, with the latest recipient being Pompey’s beneficiary, so a Caesarian intervention makes sense. But it is difficult to see the Pontic city in a text in which \textit{Comana uenit} is sandwiched between references to the capital and king of Cappadocia. This has led to the assumption that Incertus is unaware of the distinction between the two cities.\footnote{Bibliography and discussion in \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} (2013, 91 n. 65).} But that assumption is predicated on the emendation \textit{uenit}. So we need to take another look at the lacuna.\par
Desiderata include (1) a verb, (2) a syntactic differentiation between \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} that accommodates the demonstrative \textit{id}, and (3) content that keeps Caesar out of Cappadocian Comana, that allows for a reference to Comana Pontica, and that explains Caesar’s stop at Mazaca. Here are two possibilities for the missing syntax; the words in each lacuna are supplied \textit{exempli gratia}:

\begin{quote}biduum Mazacae commoratus Comana \supplied{ut confirmarentur et} uetustissimum et sanctissimum in Cappadocia Bellonae templum, quod tanta religione colitur ut sacerdos eius deae maiestate imperio potentia secundus a rege consensu gentis illius habeatur, id homini nobilissimo Lycomedi Bithyno adiudicauit …\end{quote}


\begin{quote}“stopping at Mazaca for two days in order to consolidate Comana and the shrine of Bellona, the oldest and holiest in Cappadocia, which is worshipped with such great fervor that the priest of this goddess is considered second to the king by the consent of that people in majesty, command, and power, he awarded it ({\itshape sc}. the shrine) to the very noble Lycomedes …”\end{quote}


\begin{quote}biduum Mazacae commoratus Comana \supplied{cum dissensionibus essent confecta et repeteretur} uetustissimum et sanctissimum in Cappadocia Bellonae templum, quod tanta religione colitur ut sacerdos eius deae maiestate imperio potentia secundus a rege consensu gentis illius habeatur, id homini nobilissimo Lycomedi Bithyno adiudicauit …\end{quote}


\begin{quote}“stopping at Mazaca for two days since Comana was exhausted by disputes and there was a claimant for the shrine of Bellona, the oldest and holiest in Cappadocia, which is worshipped with such great fervor that the priest of this goddess is considered second to the king by the consent of that people in majesty, command, and power, he awarded it ({\itshape sc}. the shrine) to the very noble Lycomedes …”\end{quote}

\noindent Both of them make \textit{Comana} the object of a verb in a subordinate clause whose conjunction is postponed and, after repunctuation, use \textit{adiudicauit} as the desired main verb. Incertus postpones \textit{ut} twice (45.3, 56.6) and \textit{cum} frequently (\cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} [2013] 36–39), so the stylistic oddity passes muster.\par
In the first version the lacuna contains a verb, \textit{confirmarentur}, that can govern both \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum}, which are connected by \textit{et}. There is a parallel for the double object at {\itshape BC} 1.29.3 (\textit{interim ueterem exercitum duas Hispanias confirmari … nolebat [sc. Caesar]}), and Incertus had earlier used \textit{confirmare} in a passage where Caesar was intent upon settling protracted disputes involving Eastern royalty (33.2 \textit{priusquam diuturnitate confirmarentur regum imperia}). The omission would have originated in a skip from \textit{ut} to \textit{uet}-. With this supplement Caesar’s stop in Mazaca is explained by the purpose clause but it is still hard to see Comana as anything but the Cappadocian city, given the presence of \textit{in Cappadociae … templum} and, later, \textit{regio Cappadocum genere ortus}. And the supplement sits somewhat awkwardly with \textit{id}, since the demonstrative points to a resolution of the temple issue but leaves the problem of Comana apparently unresolved.\par
In the second version the supplement contains two verbs and a connective between them. \textit{Comana} and \textit{templum} are now subjects of their respective verbs, and Caesar’s stop in Mazaca is explained by the \textit{cum}-clause. His intention of settling \textit{dissensiones} in the East was announced in the previous paragraph (65.1 \textit{praeferendum existimauit quas in prouincias regionesque uenisset eas ita relinquere constitutas ut domesticis dissensionibus liberarentur}), and the description of a territory troubled by \textit{dissensiones} is paralleled at 42.2 (\textit{prouincia … finitimo bello ac dissensionibus confecta et uastata}); the verb in this parallel may not be precisely the right one for our passage. The reference to the claimant comes from just below (66. 4 \textit{sacerdotium id repetebat} [{\itshape sc}. \textit{Lycomedes}]), where, however, the object is the priesthood rather than the shrine itself. The omission of this string of words is harder to explain than the omission of the \textit{ut}-clause, but the gap created by the reference to a solution for the temple but nothing about the trouble in Comana is less apparent, since the trouble in Comana might have been centered on control of the temple.\footnote{From Strabo it appears that Caesar’s arrangement involved both the priesthood mentioned here and a gift of land (12.3.35).} With this supplement Comana again seems to be the city in Cappadocia.\par
Both supplements deliver some but not all of the desiderata listed above. Neither acquits Incertus of confusing the two Comanas—assuming that Strabo deserves our credence—but both provide a main verb, keep Caesar out of the Cappadocian city, and explain Caesar’s stop. The syntax of each repair makes a welcome distinction between the city and the shrine, but in neither version is \textit{id} entirely unproblematic. So neither is good enough to go in the text, and we follow \cite{Klotz} and \cite{Andrieu} in indicating a lacuna.

\noindent This extract is part of Deiotarus’ speech as a suppliant before Caesar. His defense has two parts. Here, he explains that his military support of Pompey was a consequence of the absence of Caesarian troops in his region. In the following sentence he adds that he did not think he should be a judge of Roman conflicts. Caesar’s response is given in 68.1; he objects mainly to the latter sentence.\par
The main puzzle in this passage is the syntax of \textit{exercitibus imperiisque}. In the paradosis neither word is obviously connected to any expression in the vicinity, and the plural forms make a peculiar pair:

\begin{quote}… quod in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset \uline{exercitibus imperiisque} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}

\noindent Scholars have proposed numerous solutions.\par
\cite{Markland} (1723, \xref{https://books.google.com/books?id=7_JWAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA129\#v=onepage&q&f=false}{129}) proposed emending to \textit{excitusque imperiis}, transposing the connective and converting \textit{exercitibus} into a causal participle parallel to \textit{positus}.

\begin{quote}… quod in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset \uline{excitusque imperiis} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, since he was located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons and summoned by orders, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent The instrumental ablative is a neat and attractive solution to the syntax problem, and one can hypothesize a two-step innovation: first the substitution of the common word \textit{exercitibus} for the rare participle \textit{excitus}, and second the transposition of the connective to connect the two nouns. But \textit{excitus} is indeed rare. In fact the only extant example occurs at \textit{BHisp} 4.4 \textit{itaque Cn. Pompeius … litteris fratris excitus … ad Cordubam iter facere coepit}. So this solution is not entirely convincing.\par
In 1861 \cite{Kraner} (\xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c070407321?urlappend=\%3Bseq=63}{LVIIII}) suggested a slight modification to \cite{Markland}’s repair, excising the connective and thereby linking \textit{excitus} more tightly to \textit{fuisset}.

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset, \uline{excitus imperiis} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons, having been summoned by orders he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent Here the distinction between the two causal participles is hard to justify.\par
In 1873 \cite{Madvig} proposed emending \textit{exercitibus} to \textit{excitus uerbis}, pointing out that \textit{excitus} itself is too short to yield \textit{exercitibus:}

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset, \uline{excitus uerbis imperiisque} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons, having been summoned by verbal orders he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent The connective now links \textit{uerbis} and \textit{imperiis} in a hendiadys. But \textit{uerbis} does not add much to the sense of what is happening, there are no close parallels pairing \textit{uerbis} with \textit{imperiis}, and the separation between \textit{positus} and \textit{excitus} remains hard to justify.\par
In 1886 \cite{Larsen} (\xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=23}{27}) suggested a paleographically and semantically superior version of this repair:

\noindent \textit{Precibus} contributes more meaning than \textit{uerbis}, and the scribe of the archetype will have substituted \textit{exercitibus} for a less common expression beginning with \textit{ex-} and ending with \textit{-ibus}. Larsen cites a passage from Cicero’s speech for Deiotarus as evidence for the different ways in which the king’s behavior could be characterized: Cic. {\itshape Deiot}. 13 \textit{uenit (sc. Deiotarus ad Pompeium) uel rogatus ut amicus uel arcessitus ut socius uel euocatus ut is, qui senatui parere didicisset.} With Larsen’s reading Deiotarus appears to be covering himself with a similar range of options.\par
In 1887 \cite{Dinter} took a new approach to the puzzle, adding \textit{coercitus} before \textit{exercitibus imperiisque} and leaving the noun phrase as in the paradosis:

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset, \uline{coercitus exercitibus imperiisque} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons, constrained by armies and orders he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Coerceo} is not as rare as \textit{excio}, although the perfect passive participle occurs nowhere in the Caesarian corpus. The verb itself is used once elsewhere in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, of rulers who might prove ungrateful to Rome: 33.4 \textit{si essent ingrati, posse isdem praesidiis coerceri}. Similarly, there is an ablative of means with the infinitive at {\itshape BC} 1.67.4: \textit{at luce multum per se pudorem omnium oculis, multum etiam tribunorum militum et centurionum praesentiam adferre, quibus rebus coerceri milites et in officio contineri soleant}. On the whole, this suggestion is helpful in preserving the transmitted nouns and in proposing a more common verb, although the absence of any participial forms of this verb is troubling.\par
In 1889 \cite{Cornelissen} tried a drastically different approach, inserting \textit{in} before \textit{Caesaris}:

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia \supplied{\uline{in}} Caesaris habuisset \uline{exercitibus imperiisque}, in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no defenses in Caesar’s armies and orders, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent The \textit{praesidia} are now metaphorical and the armies and orders are Caesar’s, not Pompey’s. There are some parallels for \textit{Caesaris} coming between \textit{in} and its ablative object, particularly in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum}, e.g., at 23.1 \textit{ut admoniti a regis amicis qui in Caesaris erant praesidiis}, where as in our passage a verb comes between \textit{Caesaris} and the ablative dependent on \textit{in}. It is possible to explain how \textit{in} fell out in our passage, given the oddity of its placement next to a genitive.\footnote{U’s omission of \textit{in} before Pompey’s name later in the sentence may or may not be relevant.} The main difficulty with this suggestion is that all other examples of \textit{in Caesaris praesidiis} or \textit{in Caesaris castris} have a spatial sense that is lacking here, since these armies do not actually exist and so have no spatial location.\par
The next year \cite{Hoffmann1890}, who had printed the paradosis in his first edition, offered his own solution to the problem of \textit{exercitibus imperiisque,} inserting \textit{coactus} after the pair:

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset, \uline{exercitibus imperiisque }\supplied{\uline{coactus}} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons, under the compulsion of armies and orders, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Cogere} is a fairly common word in the Caesarian corpus, and this use of the participle with an ablative of means is paralleled in the {\itshape Bellum Alexandrinum:} 43.1 \textit{magnisque difficultatibus coactus}. On the whole, this is a promising suggestion, although critics have felt that the line still needed further work.\par
In 1927 \cite{Klotz}, retaining \cite{Cornelissen}’s \textit{in,} added \textit{aduersariorum} before \cite{Hoffmann1890}’s \textit{coactus}:

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia \supplied{\uline{in}} Caesaris habuisset \uline{exercitibus, imperiisque }\supplied{\uline{aduersariorum coactus}} in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no defenses in the form of Caesar’s armies, and under the compulsion of the orders of Caesar’s enemies, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey\end{quote}

\noindent The non-existent armies are now Caesar’s and the commands come from Caesar’s enemies. \cite{Klotz} is the first to take -\textit{que} as breaking up two phrases rather than joining two nouns. In doing so, Klotz diagnoses a problem, namely, that the combination of plural forms of \textit{exercitus} and \textit{imperium} is problematic, since it does not occur elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus and is rare elsewhere, even though the two words are individually very common.\footnote{Where the plurals do appear in tandem \textit{imperia} generally has a broader sense than is appropriate here: e.g., Cic. \textit{Clu}. 154 \textit{insignia, fasces, exercitus, imperia, prouinciae}.} But Klotz’ proposal requires emendation in two spots in the same phrase. The hypothesis of independent omissions is not very likely.\par
Since none of the solutions discussed has been entirely satisfactory, we have adopted a different repair. We follow most editors in inserting a participle to govern the instrumental ablatives; \cite{Hoffmann1890}’s \textit{coactus} seems the most persuasive suggestion, since it is the most common in Caesarian usage. But we place the participle before \textit{exercitibus imperiisque} and insert a connective to facilitate the coordination of \textit{positus} and \textit{coactus}:

\begin{quote}… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia Caesaris habuisset \supplied{\uline{et coactus}}\uline{exercitibus imperiisque}, in Cn. Pompei castris fuisset\end{quote}


\begin{quote}… the fact that, as he was located in a part of the world that had no Caesarian garrisons and was under the compulsion of armies and orders, he had been in the camp of Gnaeus Pompey.\end{quote}

\noindent The omission of \textit{et} and the following word might have been prompted by the ending of \textit{habuisset}. We have left \textit{exercitibus imperiisque} intact, since the \textit{exercitibus} of unspecified supporters of Pompey corresponds to the \textit{praesidia} that Caesar has not provided. Admittedly, the unusual combination is problematic. Furthermore, if Deiotarus is claiming that he was forced to join Pompey by Pompeian armies, one might expect Caesar to point out that the king did not actually engage in combat with these armies. Instead, in his reply, Caesar focuses exclusively on Deiotarus’ subsequent claim that he did not know whose \textit{imperia} to obey. To keep the focus on \textit{imperiis}, we have suggested \textit{potestatibus} as a possible alternative to \textit{exercitibus}, a term that is found in combination with \textit{imperiis}: cf. Cic. \textit{Leg.} 1.23 \textit{si uero isdem imperiis et potestatibus parent,} and Liu. 4.54.7: \textit{salii flaminesque nusquam … sine imperiis ac potestatibus relinquantur}.

\noindent The transmitted text of this passage contains a bold personification and an apparent pleonasm: \textit{recipere} has \textit{defensionem} as its subject and \textit{excusationem} as its object. A lesser objection is the fact that \textit{defensio} has a military meaning in its seven other occurrences in the \textit{corpus Caesarianum}.\par
\cite{Madvig} condemned the construction in no uncertain terms (1873, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=\%3Bseq=297}{285} n.1 “hae sordes”) and praised the repair found in \cite{Clarke}’s 1712 edition and in some manuscripts—replacing the objectionable \textit{defensionem} with \textit{defectionem}—on the grounds that “factum recipit aut non recipit defensionem excusationemque imprudentiae” ({\itshape ibid}.). However, the textual support for Madvig’s obiter dictum is rather thin. The best parallel for a “factum” as the recipient of an excuse is Cic. {\itshape Agr}. 3.5 \textit{inuidiosa lex … habet excusationem}, where the verb is different. It is in fact clear from the {\itshape TLL} entry on excusatio that a person is normally the subject of such expressions, as at {\itshape BG} 6.4.3 \textit{libenter Caesar petentibus Haeduis dat ueniam excusationemque accipit} ({\itshape TLL} 5.2.1299.73–82, with verbs including \textit{accipere}, \textit{adimere}, \textit{dare}, \textit{habere}, \textit{obtendere}, \textit{parare}, \textit{praebere}; there are two examples of \textit{recipere}). The “factum” is normally expressed with a genitive, e.g., \textit{imprudentiae} in the present passage ({\itshape TLL} 5.2.1298.55–82).\par
In 1727 \cite{Dauisius1727}, who had printed the paradosis in \cite{Dauisius1706}, criticized the emendation that \cite{Madvig} would later pronounce “certissima” on the grounds of its historical inaccuracy: Deiotarus never defected from Caesar (as Litauiccus, for example, did in {\itshape BG} 7) because he was on Pompey’s side from the beginning of the civil war.\footnote{The charge of defection does occur in Dio’s account of these negotiations, where Caesar blames {\itshape Pharnaces} for deserting his benefactor Pompey (42.47.4): \textit{ἐπεκάλεσεν αὐτῶι … ὅτι τὸν Πομπήιον τὸν εὐεργέτην ἐγκατέλιπεν}.} Instead of changing the noun, Dauisius excised \textit{defensionem eius} as a gloss on \textit{excusationem eius imprudentiae}; he also added \supplied{\textit{se}} after \textit{posse} to supply the requisite personal subject. The implicit innovations are plausible enough individually, but the combination is less so.\footnote{The repair printed by \cite{Kübler1896a} is even less plausible. He accepted the addition of \supplied{\textit{se}} but also transposed \textit{coarguisset} to follow \textit{defensionem eius} and punctuated the sixty-two words from \textit{nullam} to \textit{deprecandum} as a parenthesis.} And the historical case against \textit{defectionem} depends on a literal interpretation of a highly rhetorical passage.\par
\cite{Klotz} suggests in his apparatus that the transmitted text can perhaps be explained as a pleonasm. Cicero uses a similarly pleonastic expression for “defense by excuse” at {\itshape Rab. Post.} 27: \textit{Rufum necessitatis excusatio defendet}. The wording is different, but the concept is perhaps sufficiently similar to defend the paradosis, particularly given the problems inherent in the repairs currently on offer. The fact that \textit{defensio} is exclusively military elsewhere in the {\itshape corpus Caesarianum} should not make us reluctant to accept its forensic meaning here, since the context contains other “courtroom” words: 67.1 \textit{reorum habitu}, 67.2 \textit{iudicem esse}, 68.1 \textit{de controuersiis tetrarcharum … se cogniturum esse}.

\noindent This description of the famous site of two consequential battles—according to Pliny, Zela was \textit{nobilis clade Triarii et uictoriae C. Caesaris} ({\itshape Nat}. 6.10)—is barely legible. Editors have been variously tolerant of its difficulties since none of the words is obviously corrupt and the general picture is clear: Pharnaces established his camp on the prominent hill near Zela on which his formidable father, Mithridates, had established his own camp twenty years earlier and from which Mithridates had inflicted a devastating defeat on Roman troops led by C. Valerius Triarius.\footnote{On the battle in 67 BCE see Plut. {\itshape Luc}. 35.1, App. {\itshape Mith}. 88–89.397–408, D.C. 36.12–13. According to Appian the name of the hill was \textit{τὸ Σκότιον ὄρος} ({\itshape Mith}. 120.595). Appian ({\itshape Mith}. 89.403–404, 406) and Dio (36.12.4) situate the fighting on level ground.\label{stba-72.2-note-2}} The themes introduced here—the memory of the earlier battle and the nature of the terrain—are both prominent in the subsequent narrative.\footnote{The earlier battle: 73.2, 74.3; the terrain: 73.1–3 (valleys), 74.1–4 and 76.2 (the disadvantages of the terrain), 76.1 (the slope).}\par
The main problems in the paradosis pertain to the stretch of text \textit{quorum … Zela}.

\begin{quote}quorum editissimus unus qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem nec multo longius milibus passuum tribus abest ab Zela \end{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] The clause introduced by \textit{quorum} lacks a verb.
\item[2] The words \textit{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}, which pertain to terrain, seem out of place in the middle of a relative clause about the memory of an earlier battle. But the unusual expression (see below) is unlikely to have originated as a gloss. And the severity of this problem depends in part on what one takes to be the point of \textit{coniunctus oppido}: is the hill’s connection to Zela relevant to the tactics of the coming battle, or to the memory of both battles? As it happens, the town per se plays no role in either battle: it is nothing more than a place name for battles fought in the vicinity. Accounts of the battle of 67 BCE situate it on level ground (see above, note \ref{stba-72.2-note-2}), while Incertus situates Caesar’s battle near a \textit{collis} more than three miles from the town.
\item[3] The syntax of \textit{superioribus locis} is puzzling: by itself it might be taken as a local ablative (cf. {\itshape BC} 1.65.1 \textit{locis superioribus constitit} and possibly 12.1 \textit{superioribus locis subleuabantur;} contra, 35.3 \textit{in locis superioribus}) but with \textit{atque itineribus} it seems to be a rather loose ablative either of route (cf. 35.3 \textit{locisque superioribus iter facere instituit}) or means (cf. 30.3 \textit{castellum … brachiis … cum opere castrorum coniunxerat}). Furthermore the adjective is unexpected given the prominence of \textit{editissimus}—which places are higher than the highest hill?—and the expression \textit{superioribus … itineribus} is unparalleled.\footnote{In the apparent parallel at {\itshape BC} 1.51.2 \textit{superiorum temporum atque itinerum licentia} the adjective has a temporal sense. \cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.) suggests adding \supplied{\textit{commodis}} before \textit{itineribus}.\label{stba-72.2-note-4}}
\item[4] The grammatical connection created by \textit{nec} between \textit{habet} and \textit{abest} seems arbitrary, given the divergent referents of the two verbs, reputation for the one, terrain for the other. The latter verb seems better suited to the clause introduced by \textit{quorum editissimus}.
\item[5] The adjective \textit{unus} is strangely emphatic. There is another emphatic \textit{unus} at 25.6 \textit{Ita qui unus ex omnibus eo proelio bene rem gessit solus cum sua quadriremi uictrice periit}, but in that passage \textit{unus} prepares the way for \textit{solus}. The adjective in our passage has no comparable role. It is hard to say whether its omission by S is deliberate. Another possibility is that \textit{unus} originated in a misconstrued abbreviation, here possibly for \textit{est} (cf. ad {\itshape BC} 3.19.4, where the original might have been \textit{primo}).
\end{enumerate}\par
Problem 1 is the easiest to solve: as Clarke said in 1712 (543), one can either understand \textit{est} after \textit{unus} or assume an anacoluthon. In the latter scenario the thought initiated by \textit{editissimus unus} is eventually expressed by \textit{hunc locum Pharnaces … occupauit}. Comparable anacolutha introduced by prominent nominatives occur in both the {\itshape BG} (3.22.1–4 \textit{Adiatuanus}) and the {\itshape BC} (3.18.3–4 \textit{Vibullius}, 3.19.3–4 \textit{locutus}, 3.44.6 \textit{loca}).\footnote{See \cite{Damon2015b}, 242.} One could also address the problem by adding \supplied{\textit{est}} or excising \supplied{\textit{qui}}.\par
Problem 4, too, responds to relatively simple approaches. \cite{Oudendorp} (1737), for example, uses punctuation:

\begin{quote}quorum editissimus unus, qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis, et infelicitatem Triari, detrimentumque exercitus nostri, superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido, magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem\uline{;} nec multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela.\end{quote}

\noindent Problem 2 has been addressed by a variety of transpositions, all of them serial innovations: omission of the original string of words, addition of the string in the margin {\itshape uel sim}., insertion of the string into the text at an inappropriate spot.\par
\cite{Morus} (1780, ad loc.), who prints the paradosis, explains in a note how to address problems 1, 2, and 4 by moving \textit{superioribus … oppido} to after \textit{nobilitatem}, making the relative clause a parenthesis, and altering \textit{nec} to \textit{non}:

\begin{quote}quorum editissimus unus, \uline{(}qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis, et infelicitatem Triari, detrimentumque exercitus nostri, \surplus{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem,) \supplied{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido, non}} multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela.\end{quote}

\noindent \cite{Vielhaber1864} (25) later varied the response to problem 4 by making the verb for the \textit{quorum}-clause \textit{coniunctus \supplied{est}} and placing a period before Morus’ \textit{non}.\footnote{\cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.) comments that the addition of \supplied{{\itshape est}} is “praeter necessitatem.”}

\begin{quote}Quorum editissimus unus, qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri \surplus{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem, \supplied{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus est oppido}}\uline{. Non} multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela.\end{quote}

\noindent But later (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=652}{574}) \cite{Vielhaber1869} abandoned this complicated repair and suggested instead that \textit{superioribus … oppido} was an incorporated gloss that was subsequently corrupted.

\begin{quote}Quorum editissimus unus qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri \surplus{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem nec multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela.\end{quote}

\noindent \cite{Madvig} (1873, 1.48–49) addressed problem 2 by moving \textit{superioribus … oppido} to the end of the sentence.

\begin{quote}Quorum editissimus ({\itshape sc}. est) unus qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri \surplus{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem nec multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela, \supplied{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}}.\end{quote}

\noindent This creates a useful, if tacit, antithesis between \textit{abest} and \textit{paene coniunctus}, strengthening the topographical significance of \textit{coniunctus}. But as \cite{Vielhaber1869} says (1869, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=\%3Bseq=652}{574}) the term is “bei einer Entfernung von mehr als 3/5 Meilen auffällig.” And in this position \textit{superioribus} is oddly lacking in point: how does the close connection on high ground qualify the absolute distance between the hill and the city?\par
\cite{Larsen} (1886, \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc2.ark:/13960/t3cz4fm0n?urlappend=\%3Bseq=24}{28–29}) added a solution for problem 3 to \cite{Madvig}’s repair by turning the transposed string into a terminal ablative absolute:

\begin{quote}quorum editissimus ({\itshape sc}. est) unus qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri \surplus{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem nec multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela, \supplied{\uline{superioribus locis atque itineribus paene coniunctis oppido}}.\end{quote}

\noindent The resulting text bears a certain resemblance to the description of the terrain at Nicopolis: 36.3 \textit{quod oppidum positum} (sc. \textit{Nicopolis}) \textit{in Armenia minore est plano ipsum loco, montibus tamen altis ab duobus lateribus obiectis, satis magno interuallo ab oppido remotis}. But the presence of \textit{tamen} here makes the point of this terminal ablative much clearer.\par
Problem 3 is addressed head-on by \cite{Kübler1896a} (ad loc.), who rewrites the text thus:

\begin{quote}quorum editissimus unus, qui propter uictoriam Mithridatis et infelicitatem Triari detrimentumque exercitus nostri \uline{superioribus acceptum temporibus }\surplus{\uline{paene coniunctus oppido}} magnam in illis partibus habet nobilitatem, \supplied{\uline{paene coniunctus est oppido}} nec multo longius milibus passuum III abest ab Zela.\end{quote}

\noindent The description of the site is now much more legible, but to get from this original to the paradosis would have required a mininum of five innovations.\footnote{\cite{Kübler1896b} discusses this emendation briefly in his 1896 {\itshape Philologus} article “Recisamenta critica,” on pp. \xref{https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015029918151?urlappend=\%3Bseq=214}{154–155}.}\par
\cite{Klotz} (1927, ad loc.), pronouncing the passage a “locus nondum probabiliter emendatus,” obelizes \textit{superioribus … oppido}, as does \cite{Andrieu} (1954, ad loc.).\footnote{In his apparatus Klotz (1927, ad loc.) proposes yet another transposition, moving \textit{superioribus … oppido} earlier in the sentence, to follow \textit{unus}. (See also note \ref{stba-72.2-note-4} in this section.) The topographical information sits well there, but the arbitrariness of \textit{nec} is even more striking without \textit{paene} in close proximity.} But as was mentioned earlier, none of the words is obviously corrupt, so desperation seems unwarranted. We have used a dash to mark the anacoluthon and assumed that \textit{superioribus … oppido} was something of an afterthought, added by Incertus to explain why the two battles were remembered as having been fought at Zela, when they weren’t. The distance is also minimized later in the sentence with \textit{nec multo longius}, and \textit{superioribus} may have been prompted by \textit{excelsiore … fastigio} in the description of Zela itself. (We would have punctuated the afterthought as a parenthesis except that the profusion of dashes would have been confusing.) Incertus may have been motivated by the distinction between what was remembered locally (\textit{in illis partibus}, an otherwise surprising qualification), namely, the \textit{collis}, Mt. Scotius, and the place name, Zela, to which his readers will have attached their knowledge of these battles.

\noindent The transmitted text of a sentence that shows an incredulous Caesar watching Pharnaces lead his army onto unfavorable ground needs repair in at least three spots:

\begin{quote}cuius aliquamdiu Caesar irridebat inanem ostentationem et eo loco militum \uline{cohortationem} quem in \uline{loco} nemo sanus hostis subiturus esset cum interim Pharnaces eodem gradu quo \uline{in proelium/praeruptam} descenderat uallem ascendere aduersus arduum collem instructis copiis coepit.\end{quote}

\noindent In the first two spots the problems are clear and permit convincing resolutions.\footnote{We also note the excision of \textit{hostis} proposed by \cite{Bentley} (1742, ad loc.); the term is certainly peculiar in this context, where a more neutral word such as \textit{dux} would be more plausible, if any word at all is needed.} The archetype’s reading at the third spot, however, is a puzzle in itself. Since Pharnaces is at this moment moving up a hillside intending to fight a battle, the combination of \textit{in proelium} and the pluperfect \textit{descenderat} makes little sense. However, the presence of the unwanted expression \textit{in proelium} in both branches of the stemma (ST and U) indicates that this reading was in the archetype and in its descendants ν and μ. In the ν branch V will have substituted the synonymous \textit{in bellum} (for innovations in V see \cite{Damon2015a}, lviii-lix). The reading of μ is harder to discern: it must have had \textit{in proelium}, since U has this phrase, but it must also have had \textit{praeruptam}, which is in both U and M. It is possible but not demonstrable that these variants reached μ from the archetype (for archetypal variants see \cite{Damon2015a}, xxiv-xxv). If so, \textit{praeruptam} was not transmitted to ν’s descendants, perhaps because the hyperbaton \textit{in praeruptam … uallem} seemed more immediately problematic than \textit{in proelium}.\footnote{On hyperbata in the \textit{Bellum Alexandrinum} see Gaertner and Hausburg 2013, 36–39. Incertus is particularly fond of clause-ending hyperbata of the form adjective-verb-substantive (see the discussion of 35.3 above, n. 11).} Be that as it may, what one wants to know is whether \textit{praeruptam} reached μ by transmission, in other words, whether it may be an authentic reading.\par
The fact that the valley into which Pharnaces had descended was described as \textit{praerupta} in the preceding sentence (74.3 \textit{At Pharnaces … descendere praerupta ualle coepit}) suggests that the adjective may have been supplied here as a convenient repair for the semantic problem discussed above. On the other hand, \textit{eodem gradu} suggests that Incertus wanted the two phrases read together here, and in any case he is not particularly scrupulous about avoiding repetition (see \cite{Gaertner-Hausburg} 2013, 37 n. 38). But if \textit{in praeruptam} was the original reading, it is hard to see how \textit{in proelium} arose. It cannot have been an unconscious remembrance of a phrase used elsewhere in the {\itshape corpus}, since \textit{in proelium descendere} occurs only at Fron. {\itshape Strat}. 2.1.10 \textit{ut in proelium cum coniugibus ac liberis descenderent}, and \textit{in proelium} is altogether absent from the {\itshape corpus Caesarianum}.\par
\cite{Nipperdey} (1847, ad loc.) proposed an emendation that clarifies the origin of \textit{in proelium}:

\begin{quote}… cum interim Pharnaces eodem gradu quo in \uline{procliuem} descenderat uallem ascendere aduersus arduum collem instructis copiis coepit.\end{quote}

\noindent The noun will have arisen as a misreading of \textit{procliuem}, an adjective that appears only three times elsewhere in the {\itshape corpus} (76.1 \textit{cum in procliui detruderentur hostes}; {\itshape BC} 1.48.8 \textit{quibus erat procliue tranare flumen}; {\itshape BAfr} 10.1 \textit{omnia sibi procliuia}), in two of which it has its metaphorical meaning “easy.” {\itshape Procliuis} is not elsewhere applied to \textit{uallis}, but it is used with topographical substantives such as \textit{pauimentum}, \textit{solum}, \textit{saxum}, \textit{locus}, and \textit{uia} (see {\itshape TLL} 10.2.1537.68–1538.13 “de iis quae \surplus{qui} positionem uel formam inclinatam habent”). And it is used in antithesis with \textit{arduus} at Liu. 5.43.2 (\textit{in arduum … per procliue}) and Sen. {\itshape Dial}. 7.25.6 (\textit{in procliui … aduersus ardua}).\par
Both \textit{in praeruptam} and \textit{in procliuem} have merits, and it is difficult to choose one over the other. In the end, however, we decided to print \cite{Nipperdey}’s emendation, to indicate that we think that \textit{in praeruptam} is more likely to be a scribal innovation based on 74.3 \textit{praerupta ualle} than to be authentic text.
